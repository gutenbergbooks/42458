<p class="first">In the present volume is concluded the excellent
<i lang="es">Historia</i> of the Dominican writer Diego Aduarte, begun
in <span class="sc">Vol. XXX</span>, and continued in <span class=
"sc">XXXI</span>; the period of mission history here covered being
1608&ndash;37. Aduarte died in 1636; but the events subsequent to 1634,
with a sketch of Aduarte&rsquo;s life, are added by the hand of his
editor, Fray Domingo Gon&ccedil;alez.</p>
<p>Continuing the life of Fray Luis Gandullo, who was prominent among
the founders of the Dominican province, Aduarte narrates the marvelous
conversions and even miracles wrought by him, and many of his visions
and other wonderful experiences. In 1612, the chapter again elects Fray
Miguel de San Jacinto as provincial. The persecutions in Japan become
more widespread and severe; various incidents therein are related. Our
writer sketches the life of Fray Diego de Soria, the second bishop of
Nueva Segovia; and of another early missionary in that province,
Francisco Minayo.</p>
<p>Book ii of Aduarte&rsquo;s history recounts events from 1614 on,
beginning with Japan, where a new and more cruel persecution of the
Christians begins with that year; and orders are given by the shogun
that all priests and religious must be banished from Japan. When this
order is carried out, many of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10"
href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>missionaries remain in the
country, in hiding and disguised&mdash;traveling through the country to
instruct and console the Christians, suffering great hardships and
dangers, and finally, in most cases, dying as martyrs for their faith.
In the long biography of Fray Francisco de San Joseph Blancas, the most
interesting point is his linguistic achievements in the Tagal language,
and the introduction of printing in the Philippine Islands, which
Aduarte here ascribes entirely to Fray Francisco. This father also
learned the Chinese language, and assumed the charge of instructing the
negroes and slaves in Manila.</p>
<p>In 1615, the Cagay&aacute;n mission is much disturbed and injured by
the flight to the mountains of many Indians who had been gathered into
the mission reductions; this is caused by the machinations of the
aniteras, or priestesses of the old idols, who try to draw these
half-tamed Indians back to their old superstitions. In this year come a
large company of religious; and in 1616 the provincial elected is Fray
Bernardo de Sancta Catalina&mdash;who dies soon afterward, and of whom
Aduarte writes a long biographical account. He is succeeded as
provincial (April 15, 1617) by Fray Melchior de Man&ccedil;ano. The
persecutions in Japan steadily increase in severity, in 1615&ndash;16,
in which latter year Iyeyasu dies. In 1617 two missionaries&mdash;one a
Dominican, the other an Augustinian&mdash;deliberately go to Omura to
rebuke the daimi&ocirc; for his cruelty to the Christians, and to
preach the gospel in public; they, with other captive religious, are
put to death. Their example in so bravely enduring martyrdom encourages
and strengthens the Japanese Christians, many of whom give their lives
for the faith, and compels the respect <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>of the heathen. Other
missionaries are arrested, and suffer great privations while in
prison.</p>
<p>Aduarte recounts the progress of the work undertaken by the
Dominicans for the Chinese in Manila. For many years the missionaries
live at Binondoc, the village to which the Christian Chinese go to live
when they receive the new faith; but they conclude that it would be
better for all concerned to build a convent and church within the
Pari&aacute;n. In 1617 they begin to erect these buildings, and priests
of the order take up their residence therein, in the midst of that
great market and its crowd of traders and artisans. Their labors are
crowned with notable and prompt success&mdash;not only in securing the
baptism of the sick and dying, but in the instruction of those who are
in health, who carry the gospel into their own country, wherein the
missionaries hope to effect a great conversion some day. The church
first erected is a poor and unsubstantial affair; but afterward a large
and very handsome church is built&mdash;in the Chinese fashion, of wood
shaped and fitted without any nails. When the Pari&aacute;n is burned
in 1628, the church is saved by placing an image of the Virgin in front
of the approaching flames. Later, the timbers begin to decay, and
another building is erected, with stone pillars; its walls are covered
with paintings, which serve greatly for the instruction of the heathen.
During fifteen years, the number of baptisms in this church amounts to
4,752. The Dominicans win the great respect and affection of the
Chinese, who seldom die without having received baptism.</p>
<p>This order extends its labors to some other countries. China is, of
course, the chief goal of its desires; but the Dominicans are unable to
effect an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>entrance therein. One of the friars, attempting to
go there (1618), is obliged by storms to land on Formosa; and to his
subsequent report of the advantages of this island is ascribed its
later acquisition by the Spaniards. Another mission sets out for Korea,
but is unable to go farther than Nangasaki, and is thus frustrated.
Twenty-four new missionaries arrive this year from Spain. A new
residence is established at Cavite, the priests in which accomplish
much good, among both Spaniards and natives. A new mission is begun in
the Babuyan Islands, north of Cagay&aacute;n; it is very arduous and
full of privations, but the religious gladly labor therein, and find
the people excellent Christians, although they are most poor and needy.
The fathers often ask alms from the convents and the Christians in
Nueva Segovia, to help these poor disciples of the Lord. Some of the
religious who have remained in Japan are martyred in this year of 1618;
yet amid the fierce persecutions new converts are made, and the native
Christians show much loyalty and generosity to their spiritual
fathers.</p>
<p>In 1619 the intermediate chapter session meets at Nueva Segovia, on
which occasion the college of Santo Thomas at Manila is formally added
to the province; an historical sketch of this institution is presented.
In November of that year occurs an unusually severe earthquake in
Luz&oacute;n, of which various features and incidents are recorded.
Among the buildings overthrown is the Dominican convent in Manila, all
its inmates, however, escaping in safety. In 1621 Fray Miguel Ruiz is
elected provincial. On November 6 of that year occurs a revolt among
the Gadanes in northern Luz&oacute;n, of which a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>full
account is given. One of the Dominican missionaries, Fray Pedro de
Santo Thomas, courageously goes alone and unarmed, to the mountain
stronghold of the insurgents, to win them back; and some months later
he returns with three hundred families of these rebels, who settle
peaceably on the lower lands. Aduarte fills chapters xviii&ndash;xxvi
with accounts of martyrdoms of Dominicans in Japan, during
1621&ndash;23, and sketches of their lives&mdash;matter which is
presented to our readers in brief synopsis, as but indirectly
concerning the Philippines.</p>
<p>The election of provincial in 1625 elevates to that dignity Fray
Bartholom&eacute; Martinez, who has long labored among the Chinese of
Manila. In this year occurs another revolt among some of the
Cagay&aacute;n Indians; two religious are treacherously slain by them,
and then they flee to the mountains. In 1626, Fernando de Silva sends
an expedition to conquer Formosa, which is accompanied by Dominican
missionaries, who hope to find in Formosa a stepping-stone to an
entrance for them into China. A fortified post is established in the
island by the Spaniards; the Dominicans act as spiritual guides for the
soldiers, and, after learning the native language, are able to win the
confidence of the inhabitants and begin instructing them. Many of the
missionaries in the province die, but a re&euml;nforcement comes to
them in this same year. In 1627 is held the intermediate
chapter-session. By that time the revolted Mandayas have been pacified,
and by the efforts of their Dominican pastors induced to return to
their villages and to the care of the missionaries. In this year occur
many martyrdoms in Japan, of which accounts are given. In 1628, the
four orders of friars in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>Philippines unite to send a
re&euml;nforcement of missionaries to Japan, but this attempt is
frustrated by the wreck of their ship. Aduarte at this time arrives at
Manila with a large company of religious. A Spanish expedition is sent
to Camboja, and the Dominicans send missionaries thither; but both
enterprises result in failure. In Formosa they are making some
progress.</p>
<p>The provincial elected in 1629 is Fray Francisco de Herrera. Soon
afterward dies Fray Bartolom&eacute; Martinez, of whom Aduarte writes a
long biography; he ends his life in the Formosa mission, which he had
established. The persecutions in Japan continue (1629&ndash;30),
hundreds being martyred for the faith, and rigorous search being made
everywhere for all Christians. It is with difficulty that any news of
events there can be sent from that country. At the end of 1630, some
Spaniards, accompanied by two Dominican friars, go on an embassy to the
Chinese city of Ucheo; on the way, the Chinese crew mutiny, and kill
most of the Spaniards. Four of these, including one of the friars,
escape to the Chinese coast; the father remains there, and labors among
the heathen. In December, 1633, the preaching of the gospel is
introduced into Itui, in Luz&oacute;n; two Dominican friars go thither,
of whose mission, and of that region and its people, some account is
given, followed by a long biography of Fray Tom&aacute;s Gutierrez,
head of the mission. The new provincial this year is Fray Domingo
Gon&ccedil;alez, Aduarte&rsquo;s editor; at this session of the chapter
an important change is made, the abolition of the intermediate chapter.
The missions are extended farther than ever before, but new workers are
greatly needed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>Many religious meet a martyr&rsquo;s death in
Japan this year, and the persecution steadily increases in severity;
biographical sketches of several martyrs are given, one of whom had
achieved much in Formosa. In that island arises a rebellion among the
natives, who murder (1633) one of the missionaries.</p>
<p>Aduarte describes the mission to the Mandayas of northern
Luz&oacute;n, begun in 1631; it has been very successful, and many of
those fierce and warlike people are now quite tamed and Christianized.
The martyrdoms (in 1634) of several missionaries and Christian women in
Japan, with sketches of their lives, are related. Two chapters are
devoted to an account of the Dominican missions in China, which contain
many devout Christians; at times, the missionaries are in danger of
being slain by mobs. The Dominican mission in Formosa has not
accomplished many conversions, and it has lost many devoted
missionaries.</p>
<p>At this point ends Aduarte&rsquo;s own work in this history; the
remaining chapters are added by his editor, Fray Domingo
Gon&ccedil;alez. He relates in full the late effort made by Fray Diego
Collado to divide the province of Filipinas, and to appropriate its
best posts and revenues for his congregation of &ldquo;Barbones.&rdquo;
This attempt greatly disturbs Aduarte, whose last days are saddened,
and perhaps even shortened, thereby. But not long after his death this
cloud passes away, and the province is restored to its former
condition&mdash;a result mainly ascribed to the intervention of the
Virgin Mary; and Collado&rsquo;s new congregation melts away.
Gon&ccedil;alez then presents a long and elaborate biography of the
illustrious Aduarte, which we abridge considerably, retaining
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name=
"pb16">16</a>]</span>especially such information about that prelate,
and such account of the missions, as has not already appeared in his
<i>Historia</i>. His virtues are recounted at length, and the many
benefits which he secured for his order, for the poor and needy
everywhere, and for the Indians.</p>
<p>Fray Gon&ccedil;alez completes Aduarte&rsquo;s history up to the
year 1637, thus comprising the first fifty years of the history of the
Philippine Dominican province. In that year, Fray Carl&oacute;s Gant is
elected provincial; and in Japan the last Dominican friars remaining
there are martyred, of whose lives and deaths sketches are given. At
the end of the book is printed a letter from Felipe IV to the Dominican
provincial at Manila, ordering that the recent partition of the
province be annulled, and Collado sent back to Spain.</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter LXXI</h3>
<h3 class="main">The arrival at Manila of father Fray Luis, his
assignment to Pangasinan and the events there</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Father Fray Luis was assigned to the province of
Pangasinan and went there in the company of the two other fathers who
were sent to the same place. Suffering from disease as a result of
exposure, he was miraculously cured. The Lord wrought miraculous
conversions by means of father Fray Luis, and supported him in his
sufferings and illness with visions. Being taken back to Manila for
care, and fearing that he might be sent to some other province, he
prayed God to renew his strength that he might return to Pangasinan.
The Lord heard his prayer and he was able to return to the duties which
he loved. The Lord blessed the mere word of father Fray Luis, sometimes
even more than the great labors of other religious; and he took as his
special charge those Indians who had been given up by others. At one
time when news came that smallpox was raging in one of the villages
named Bimmalay, and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href=
"#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>many children were dying in it,
father Fray Luis instantly went there to baptize as many of the
children as he could. The fathers were not usually permitted to baptize
the children, except in cases where it was certain that they were not
going to live, and then they were permitted to do so only as a result
of prayers and importunities. At one time a soldier came to
Binalatongan with news that Don Luis Perez das Mari&ntilde;as was dying
in the province of Ylocos. He sent word to father Fray Luis, but
without asking him to come, as the sisters of Lazarus wrote to the
Lord. Father Fray Luis went to his choir to intercede for his friend,
and there remained constantly in prayer and sacrifice until he received
news that he was better. From the very day when the soldier reached
father Fray Luis, the governor began to recover his health. On many
occasions sick children were healed by the prayers of father Fray Luis.
He was ready to risk his life for his duties. In many cases it seemed
as if God had kept children alive only until they received baptism that
they might be saved.]</p>
<p>A case which illustrates this point happened to father Fray Luis in
Calasiao. He would never tell of this unless compelled by his
obedience. He was called upon to see a child who had been baptized, and
who was dying; and he went there with a boy named Andresillo, and with
others. When they came near the house where the child was, they heard a
great lamentation with which they were weeping over him; and in another
house very near they heard a great noise of people who were drinking,
as was then very common among the heathen. Among others was their chief
named Catongal, a man fierce by nature, and furious when he had taken
wine. On <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>this occasion he came up with the others, full of
wine, and said to the father, &ldquo;You kill
many&rdquo;&mdash;intimating that he killed them with baptism, because
few of those who received it escaped. The father replied that the
reason of this was, that the Indians did not permit the children to be
baptized until there was no hope for their lives; and he said that the
good that the religious did to them would cause them to rejoice greatly
if they knew it. Catongal was not mollified by this; and the father
tried to leave him to go on, but it seemed best to have the child
shrouded first that he might take it and bury it&mdash;to prevent
superstitious acts, such as were customary. He saw it lying dead in the
arms of an Indian woman; and, looking upon it as such, he directed them
to shroud it. But a voice within him seemed to say that he should
repeat a gospel. He went to look at it again, found upon it all the
marks of death, and said, &ldquo;Why should I say a gospel for
it?&rdquo; They shrouded it; but he was still more urged on by that
inner impulse to repeat the gospel, until at last he did so. It was the
gospel of St. John, <i lang="la">In principio erat verbum</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e334src" href="#xd21e334" name="xd21e334src">1</a>
After he had repeated this he made the sign of the cross upon the brow
of the infant, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, I ask no miracles of thee; but if
it is to thy glory, the credit of thy faith, and the conversion of
these heathen, I pray thee to work them.&rdquo; He added, <i lang=
"la">Evangelica lectio sit tibi salus et protectio</i>, placing his
hand upon the head of the child; and, before he took away his hand, the
Lord looked upon the child and gave it life. All were astonished, and
the father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>in confusion said, in order to humiliate himself,
that it could not have been dead; and the chief was convinced that the
fathers did not kill children. The child sucked immediately, like a
well and healthy child. It would have been a miracle, even though it
were not dead, for it so suddenly to have recovered its health. Father
Fray Luis passed the rest of that day in great embarrassment, being
anxious lest some part of what had happened should be attributed to
him, as the instrument of it. On the following day he went to ask how
the child was, and found it well and strong. He asked the Indians who
were there what they thought of the event, and, before they replied,
the Lord gave him an answer from within: &ldquo;This is excessive
curiosity.&rdquo; He blamed himself severely, and was so ashamed that
he went away immediately, and never more looked upon the child or spoke
of the matter; and on the occasions which offered themselves for any
father to make any reference to it (because it had been public), he
changed the subject of conversation, without appearing to understand.
[In the villages of Gabon and Magaldan, father Fray Luis succeeded in
overcoming the hardness of heart of the heathen.]</p>

<h3 class="main">Some special favors received by father Fray Luis from
the Lord, and some temptations which he suffered from the enemy.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[However glorious the success of father Fray Luis in
this country, he was desirous of going to Great China, the conversion
of which the religious of this region had most at heart. He was taught
in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>vision that the conversion of China was soon to be
attempted and saw also a vision of a man such as the missionaries to
China ought to be. He was constant in prayer and had frequent visions
which guided him in his religious life. The Lord granted him the
blessing of great purity. At one time, having been careless in prayer,
he was visited by the Lord with a punishment of strange trembling which
went from the feet to the top of his head, and seemed as if it would
shatter his bones. When the fathers of this province decided to send
two to make an exploration of the great kingdom of China, father Fray
Miguel de Benavides asked for the prayers of father Fray
Luis&mdash;and, in particular, that the idols might fall to the earth
before the presence of God. Father Fray Luis offered his prayers, and
received from God the reply that he asked much. But he answered,
&ldquo;Thou canst do it, O Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not only favors which the Lord grants His servants; hence
father Fray Luis suffered many temptations of the devil, which were
permitted by the Lord that the virtues of the father might take firmer
roots. At one time the devil appeared to him in the form of Christ; but
father Fray Luis, not being moved by the affection which he commonly
felt for holy visions, said to him, &ldquo;Thou art not that which thou
seemest.&rdquo; When father Fray Luis made the sign of the cross, the
devil took the form of a great cat, fierce, black, and terrible, which
by sending fire from its eyes and mouth exhibited its rage and torment.
&ldquo;That is your real form, I think,&rdquo; said the father, and
without paying any further attention to him, he went on with his holy
exercises. The devil strove to interfere with him in his prayer, but he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>was able to drive him away. He was at times
tempted to be guilty of improprieties in saying mass, such as looking
into the chalice, but the angels protected him. The devils at times
strove to make him flee from the church where he was performing his
discipline.</p>
<p>Father Fray Luis suffered as much from the temptations of others as
from his own. He comforted Brother Juan de Soria of Manila, who, under
the direction of God, laid aside the habit of the order. On another
occasion, he assisted a novice who was moved by affection for a woman.
He had a vision of Christ crucified, with drops of blood falling from
his head upon his breast, but not upon the ground; this signified that
the novice should leave the order, but not to his destruction.. He did
so, and was married; but in a few days he was left alone, his wife
going to the aid of her poor and widowed mother. This the Lord seemed
to have ordained. On another occasion, father Fray Luis succeeded in
converting a Spanish sinner of the most obstinate sort, who had been
exiled from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to the Philippinas for his scandalous
life. The wretch confessed, and received communion, girt himself with a
haircloth garment, and, during the rest of his life (during which he
was confined in prison), he fasted often on bread and water.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The fervor of spirit of father Fray Luis, and his
expedition to China</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Although grace perfects nature, it may work so
vehemently that it weakens it and takes from it health and even life.
This happened in the case of father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25"
href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>Fray Luis, who, although he was
of robust constitution, sometimes lost his health and was in great
danger of death as the result of the vehemence of his spirit in
receiving the favors of God. He prayed to the Lord to moderate this
vehemence of spirit, and begged that he would take it from him. Father
Fray Juan de Soria prayed the Lord to take from father Fray Luis this
intensity, and to give it to Don Luis Perez das Mari&ntilde;as. From
that day forward the father lived with the greatest calmness, while the
knight became so fervent of spirit that he seemed like a living fire;
and finally he said to father Fray Luis that he should die of the love
of God. Father Fray Luis, after having received this peace and calm,
became eager to go to the conversion of China. Father Fray Juan had a
vision of Christ our Lord, seated upon a very spirited horse, which was
biting the bit and leaping about. The saddle, the girths, the reins,
and all the other accoutrements all seemed so weak that saddle and
horseman were sure to fall to the ground; but he held his seat firmly,
and made charges in one direction and another, brandishing a lance with
great dexterity. The horseman said to the father, &ldquo;Who, think
you, can control this horse?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Thou only
knowest, Lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is I alone,&rdquo; said the Lord,
giving him an inward understanding that this horse represented China,
and the weak accoutrements signified the scarcity of ministers for its
conversion. He added aloud, &ldquo;Go straightway and tell Fray Luis
what thou hast seen, which is a corroboration of what has at other
times been said to him.&rdquo; Visions were manifested to others, which
ratified the visions which had already shown Fray Luis that he was to
go to China. Before the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href=
"#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>departure of the governor Gomez
Perez, Cathalina Diaz&mdash;a Spanish woman of holy life, to whom God
vouchsafed to see the future in visions, at times&mdash;had a vision of
the governor with his head cut open and bathed in his blood, the death
of the governor by treachery being prophesied in this way. Although the
difficulties of going to China seemed as a result of this act of
treachery to be greatly increased, in reality the Lord made it the
means by which father Fray Luis was sent there; for he received a
commission as ambassador, in company with father Fray Juan de Castro.
The ambassadors, reaching the province of Canton instead of that of
Chincheo, for which they were bound, were arrested as pirates. Father
Fray Luis thus had the opportunity to convert an apostate Christian
among the Chinese. He also found many slaves from Macan who had
apostatized in that country; and to them he preached with much spirit,
but little fruit. The voyage was one on which they suffered greatly,
particularly father Fray Luis, who traveled with nothing but the habit
in which he was clothed; and they were exposed to the rain and to the
cold, which was excessive. The viceroy of Canton was very wrathful with
them because they did not show him the courtesy customary in that
country, threatened them, and commanded them to leave the province
within fifteen days, taking with them not more than twenty-five picos
of rice. On his way back to the port he found a number of apostates,
but was unable to bring them back to the faith.</p>
<p>There is a law of the king of China that any poor foreigner shall be
supported at the public expense so long as he is in the kingdom; but
that, if he desires to depart, he shall pay the mandarin the cost of
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>clothing, and something more. The allowance was
twelve maravedis a day. This is sufficient for three meals, since
things are cheap in that country. It is plain from this that there is
no law in China against admitting foreigners. On the contrary, there is
a law to attract them and to keep them. Knowing this, the slaves of the
Portuguese in Macan flee to China, where they have their liberty and
are well received. Father Fray Luis made one or two conversions.
Neither in Chincheo nor in Canton did they find a trace of the galley
which they sought, because it had gone to Cochinchina. The mandarins in
Chincheo played a trick upon them, when the fathers asked permission
for religious to go from Manila to their country. Pretending to give
it, the mandarins handed them a plate of silver with some Chinese
characters upon it, for which they received large payment. The father
obtained this money as alms from the Spaniards who accompanied him on
the voyage; but, when he showed the plate in Manila, it was found only
to give permission to buy food there without hindrance. At the time of
this journey father Fray Luis was actually prior of the convent of
Manila. On one Easter day he had a vision of the Holy Spirit coming
down upon all the religious of the convent of Manila. After his term
was at an end, he was assigned to Nueva Segovia, where the faith had
been newly planted.]</p>

spite of the high offices which he held in the order, he had not even,
as many good religious have, an image or any other trifling thing of
his own. When he was ambassador in China, he left the rich table of Don
Fernando de Castro and sustained himself, as one in poverty, by the
allowance granted to the poor in China. Contrary to his nature, he was
very humble. He was devout in prayer, and careful in saying the divine
offices. He distributed his time with the greatest accuracy. He was
most modest in the presence of women, and, though he sometimes had to
speak to them, he never looked upon their faces. He was so charitable
and tender-hearted that, when the judges were about to execute any
rigorous sentence, they always concealed it from father Fray Luis,
because they knew they could not resist his prayers for pity and
pardon. He could not bear offenses against God, however willing to
suffer wrongs to himself. He slept on a mat on the floor of his cell.
His pillow was a piece of wood hollowed to make it light. Though the
rules of the order permitted him two blankets, one to lie on and the
other to cover himself with, he contented himself with one, folding it
so that it would fulfil both offices. He wore his serge tunic a month
without changing it, which in such a hot country causes great
annoyance, because of the great amount of perspiration. He said that
custom had made it not uncomfortable for him. He constantly wore a
hair-shirt next <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>his skin, and over that a corselet of mail. In his
extreme old age, the bishop of Nueva Segovia compelled him to lay this
last aside. He wore his breeches in such a way that the fastenings cut
into the flesh of his legs. He was very sparing in his eating, giving
his suppers, when the constitutions permit them to us, to the poor; and
his noon allowance was more theirs than his. His lunch was two biscuit
crusts and a banana, or two guavas, when there were any; and except at
these times he neither ate nor drank. When he was vicar of the convent
of Nueva Segovia, a father visited him as his guest, bringing with him
two crawfish, which he boiled and put on the table; but father Fray
Luis would not permit them to be eaten, saying it was not a feast, that
they should have anything so unusual. He scourged himself every night,
with the energy which was his by nature. He was most patient, and,
though his body was mortified, his spirit was open to divine
influences. He had great power of insight into the souls of those whom
he saw. At one time he caused the bishop of Nueva Segovia, whose
vicar-general he was, to dismiss two youths of his
household&mdash;saying that he saw in them the marks of wickedness, and
that one of them was a thief and the other a traitor. This was not
known at the time, but the truth was afterwards discovered, one of them
having ransacked a desk of the bishop&rsquo;s and the other having been
condemned to be hanged for murder. When he was engaged in
contemplation, his mind was so absorbed that he could hear and see
nothing else than the visions of God. This life of penitence continued
from his youth to an old age of almost eighty years. In his last
illness he was taken to the convent of Sancto Domingo <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>at
Manila, where he died. Testimony of miracles wrought by him during his
life was given after his death. He is mentioned with honor in the
records of the provincial chapter of 1612 and in the general chapter
held at Bolonia in 1615.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The election as provincial of father Fray Miguel de
San Jacintho, and the condition of the province and Japon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the thirteenth of May, 1612, father Fray Miguel de
San Jacintho was a second time elected as provincial, not because there
was any lack of religious of much virtue, knowledge, and prudence to
take the place of father Fray Baltasar Fort&mdash;who had just
completed his term, and had governed like an angel&mdash;but because
father Fray Miguel had left all the religious of the province so
devoted to his good government that they finally determined to elect
him again. They regarded it as more prudent to select one whom they
knew by experience to be of great skill in the government of the
province, than to try the government of others who, though they gave
good hopes, could not offer so much certainty.</p>
<p>[At this time the bishop of Macan, Don Fray Juan de la Piedad, was
in Manila. He was a religious of our order; and when he saw the
interest of our religious here in the conversion of the Chinese, he was
desirous that some of the fathers of the order who understood the
Chinese language might be given to him to enter the kingdom by way of
Macan. Two fathers, Thomas Mayor&mdash;a very successful minister among
the Chinese race, and excellent in their language<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>&mdash;and Bartolome Martinez, were assigned for
this purpose; but they met with so much opposition at Macan from the
religious of another order that they were unable to carry out their
purpose. Father Fray Thomas went to Espa&ntilde;a, and father Fray
Bartholome returned to the Philippinas. Their voyage was not entirely
without fruit, inasmuch as it resulted in the conversion of one
Chinaman from Chincheo.</p>
<p>At this time, although our religious and the Christian people in the
kingdom of Figen in Japon enjoyed peace and quiet, there were
persecutions in other kingdoms of that realm. After the death of Father
Gregorio Cespedes of the Society of Jesus in the kingdom of Bugen, in
1611, the tono of that region, who had protected Christianity out of
respect for the father, banished two other fathers who were there, and
tore down the churches. The tono of Firando martyred in October of this
year three Christians; and that of Caratzu,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e400src" href="#xd21e400" name="xd21e400src">2</a> a cruel
renegade, banished many. Thus the devil began that which afterwards
took place. The Lord gave warning, by means of crosses miraculously
found, of the persecution which was to occur. In this year there went
to Japon father Fray Alonso Navarrete and father Fray Domingo de
Valderrama, sent there by father Fray Baltasar Fort; and in the
following year father Fray Baltasar himself, at the end of his term as
provincial, went as vicar-provincial to this kingdom.</p>
<p>For a long time the emperor of Japon<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e405src" href="#xd21e405" name="xd21e405src">3</a> had shown
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>much dislike to Christianity, and in the year 1612
he began to persecute it. Don Pablo Dayfachi, the secretary of a man
who was very intimate with the emperor, received a great quantity of
money from Don Juan, tono of Arima, to help him in the recovery of some
lands which had been lost by his ancestors in war. Don Pablo, who was a
Christian, could do nothing for the cause of Don Juan, who complained
to the emperor. The emperor commanded that Don Pablo should be burned
alive in the sight of his wife, and that his son should be killed. The
emperor thereupon began to persecute the Christians, saying that deeds
like these were not done by the Japanese, and that Don Pablo had
degenerated from them because he was a Christian. Fourteen knights with
their wives and families and servants were exiled. The tono of Arima
was banished, because he had endeavored to get back by favors lands
which others had gained by war, and was finally executed. A certain
English heretic, named Guillermo Adam [<i>i.e.</i>, Will Adams], who
knew the Japanese language and who pleased the emperor by giving him an
account of European affairs, vomited forth the hate which he felt
against our holy faith whenever he had opportunity. He told him that
the plan of the king our lord to conquer kingdoms is to send religious
first, that they may make the way plain for soldiers, citing for
example Nueva Espa&ntilde;a and the Philippinas&mdash;although, in
point of fact, neither there nor here did religious precede, but
invaders who intended to conquer the country. In addition to this,
Safioye, the governor of Nangasaqui, had difficulties with certain
fathers, and had complained of them to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>emperor.
The result was that the hatred of the emperor for Christianity grew
greater and greater. He finally commanded all the churches in that part
of Japon known as Cami to be demolished, and gave the same commands for
the kingdom of Quanto.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e415src" href=
"#xd21e415" name="xd21e415src">4</a> He required the Christians in
certain parts of the country to deny their faith. A number of the
Christians proved weak; while of those who refused to obey the commands
some were martyred, some banished, and some driven to the mountains.
The conduct of the governors in different parts of the country varied
from very great rigor to as much kindness as was consistent with
obeying the commands of the emperor. The tono of Figan, who had shown
so many favors to our order, directed the religious of our order to
leave the kingdom, but did not at that time persecute the Christians.
The command to depart was received by the religious in September, 1613.
Two of the religious retained their habit, and went on to Nangasaqui;
but the third, disguising himself in Japanese costume, fled to the
country of Omura, and went about secretly animating and encouraging the
Japanese Christians. Don Miguel, the tono of Arima, who had married a
granddaughter of the emperor,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e422src" href=
"#xd21e422" name="xd21e422src">5</a> requested eight gentlemen of his
household to pretend to have abandoned the faith, in order that he
might satisfy the emperor that he had ceased to be a Christian. Five
finally consented. The other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href=
"#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>three were executed with their wives
and children, eight persons in all, in October, 1613. They were burned
alive with a slow fire. The religious having been driven out from
nearly all the kingdoms and having assembled in Nangasaqui, two of our
religious were sent out to go secretly to comfort the persecuted
Christians, to hear their confessions, and to celebrate the
sacraments.]</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter LXXVI</h3>
<h3 class="main">The servant of God, Don Fray Diego de Soria, bishop of
Nueva Segovia, and one of the founders of this province.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Among the most highly honored religious in this
province a very important place is taken by Don Fray Diego de Soria,
second bishop of Nueva Segovia. It was he who began the conversion in
this province, and who might therefore be called the father in Christ
of that church. Father Fray Diego was a native of Yebenes, near Toledo,
and professed religion in the convent of the order at Oca&ntilde;a.
Giving signs of promise as a student and a preacher, he was sent to the
college of Alcala, where he continued to follow the rigorous rules of
the order forbidding the eating of flesh. When the holy and prudent
vicar-general, Fray Juan de Castro, assigned his companions to their
various duties, he gave father Fray Diego the chief place by making him
superior of the convent which was to be founded in the city of Manila.
The number of the religious at that time was so few that the superior
of Manila rang the bells, assisted in the singing, took messages to the
sacristy, and was general confessor of the many who, influenced
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>by the great virtue of the new religious (the
Dominicans), came to put their consciences in their care. The Lord had
endowed father Fray Diego with two qualities which appear to be opposed
to each other. The first was natural freedom of speech in rebuking evil
with great courage and zeal; the other was marked gentleness and
suavity of nature. At one time when the governor of Manila&mdash;who
was a very good Christian and a learned man<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e439src" href="#xd21e439" name="xd21e439src">6</a>&mdash;was
confessing to him, a certain difficulty arose in which it seemed to
father Fray Diego that the governor had erred. When the governor strove
to defend his conduct, father Fray Diego said to him that in this
matter he was, although learned, not a judge but a party, and indeed
defendant; that in cases of conscience the confessor alone was the
judge; and that, after reflection, he had formed his conclusion, which
was that the governor&rsquo;s conduct could not be approved. He
required him to accept his decision or to seek a confessor elsewhere.
The governor, with tears in his eyes, professed his readiness to obey.
At one time when a very rich man was sick, and feared death and the
judgment, he sent to call father Fray Diego to him that he might
confess; but the father refused to go, sending back as an answer that
the rich man must return the tribute which he had wrongfully taken from
an encomienda, and must give the Indians there a minister. The sick man
put himself in father Fray Diego&rsquo;s hands, and thus his conscience
was composed, to the great advantage of the wronged Indians. When the
bishop of these islands, Don Fray Domingo de Sala&ccedil;ar, was about
to set out for Espa&ntilde;a, he asked for father Fray Diego as a
companion; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>but the governor at that time [<i>i.e.</i>, Gomez
Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as], being very different from the previous one,
refused to permit him to go to Espa&ntilde;a, fearing the freedom with
which he might speak there. Father Fray Diego was therefore sent to
Pangasinan, where he learned the language of the Indians; thence he
went to Nueva Segovia, being the first minister to the Indians there.
Among them he made many conversions, especially that of the most
important Indian in that region, Don Diego Siriban. He was afterward
elected prior of Manila, and was then sent as procurator to
Espa&ntilde;a. He went on his voyage in complete poverty, trusting in
the Lord for what he might need. He received enough not only for the
support of himself and his companion, but for the purchase of the
convent and garden of San Jacintho&mdash;where, from that time forward,
the religious who came from Espa&ntilde;a to this province were lodged.
This was so important a matter that if father Fray Diego had done
nothing else for this province, this would have been enough to entitle
him to its gratitude and perpetual thanks, since it receives here a
perpetual benefit whenever new religious come. He had planned for other
similar prudent arrangements in Espa&ntilde;a, but the province
declined them for the time, failing to see the advantage of them; and
afterward, when they were desired they could not be obtained, because
there was no Fray Diego de Soria in Espa&ntilde;a. In that country,
great and small thronged to consult him in regard to spiritual matters,
for he had singular power in prudent counsel. He gave his chief
attention to sending many good religious to the Philippinas, and for
this purpose went on to Roma clad in the same lowly fashion as in his
poor province. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>He was very small of stature, and went clothed in
a habit of serge which was short and patched. In spite of his
unfavorable appearance, he made a great impression, not only upon the
general of the order, but upon the supreme pontiff, who at that time
was Clement VIII. The pope desired to retain father Fray Diego with him
in Roma, in order to put into execution the reformation of all the
religious orders; but the father was unable to remain, because he was
very much occupied with assembling religious for this province. It
usually happens that many of those religious who have purposed to come
to the Philippinas have fallen off; but in the case of father Fray
Diego not one of those who had been assigned and prepared for this
journey failed him, while many others came to see if they might be
accepted. This happened at the time of the great plague of 1601, which
raged with especial fury in Sevilla, where the religious were to
assemble. Father Fray Diego was highly regarded at court, especially by
Queen Margarita. The bishopric of Nueva Caceres in these islands was
vacant, and was offered to father Fray Diego, who declined to accept it
because he did not understand the language of the Indians of that
region. But when the bishopric of Nueva Segovia was offered to him, he
could find no excuse for declining it. It was desired to keep him in
Espa&ntilde;a in some bishopric; but, as he wrote, he would not give up
his poor apostolic bishopric for the chief bishopric in Espa&ntilde;a.
When he became bishop, he did not change his manner of living or lay
aside his serge habit. The only thing which he did to maintain his
dignity as a bishop was to keep one servant. He kept his pectoral
covered with his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>scapular, until the nuncio directed him to make
his appearance more dignified, and to wear his pectoral openly. His
prudence was so highly regarded that he was asked to carry the news of
her mother&rsquo;s death to the daughter of the Duchess of Lerma, the
wife of the Conde de Niebla, which he did with such discretion that she
accepted her bereavement with Christian resignation. On his departure
from Espa&ntilde;a, he brought with him a good company of religious. On
the way he was delivered, as by the hand of God, from some Moorish
galliots. When the others were rejoicing at the opportunity of
disembarking at the island of Guadalupe to get wood and water, the
bishop was in great anxiety, as if he saw the evil that was to follow;
and strove, but without success, to keep the others from going on the
land. The bishop disembarked, and after saying mass instantly returned
to the ship. The rest of the religious, following the usual custom of
those who go to that island, remained till evening. Five of them lost
their lives, and four came back wounded, by the arrows of the Indians
on that island. Somewhat later, a storm attacking the fleet, some of
the other vessels were lost; but that in which the bishop was came safe
to land&mdash;as it seemed, miraculously. In Nueva Espa&ntilde;a he
inspected the convents of the province, under direction of the pope,
the general of the order, and the king; and he performed this
visitation with such justice that even those who were grieved by his
chastisement were obliged to admit that he was a saint. On the way a
mule laden with a number of rich and exquisite pieces of cloth which
had been given him in Espa&ntilde;a by many lords, and by the queen
herself, for his pontifical vestments, was drowned. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>All that
the bishop said was <i lang="la">Dominus dedit; Dominus
abstulit</i>&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord gave it, and the Lord has taken it
away; let Him be praised for all things.&rdquo; The muleteer was
overcome with shame; but the bishop consoled him, and caused him to be
paid as if he had delivered his entire load safely.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[After reaching his bishopric, Don Fray Diego made a
visitation of it. Striving so far as possible to relieve the Indians of
burdens and of other labor, he made these visitations with as little
baggage as possible. He immediately paid those whom it was necessary to
cause to carry loads, and put the Indians to no expense whatsoever,
even in matters in which he might justly have done so. He constantly
wished to give them much, and not to ask even for the little which was
his due. He delighted in labor, and rejoiced particularly when there
were many to be confirmed. He observed the discipline and the rules of
prayer of this province. He rose at dawn and prayed until six, when he
said mass and gave devout thanks. If there was any business to be done,
he gave audience or attended to necessary matters. When he was not
obliged to attend to any of these occupations, he read and meditated
upon holy books and upon the sacred scripture and its expositors. He
did not generally write, but read and meditated, and received the Lord.
Thus he was occupied up to the time for saying prayers at the sixth and
the ninth hour; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40"
name="pb40">40</a>]</span>then he ate some eggs and fish, as if he were
still in the convent of the order. After his meal, he conversed with
his companion upon some useful subject; and, after resting awhile,
returned to the exercise of prayer until the time of saying vespers.
Then, if necessary, he gave audience, or engaged in works of piety; and
then he returned to his sacred reading and contemplation. He never had
any other entertainment or amusement, however lawful, nor did he go out
to refresh himself in the garden, or in the chase, or in fishing,
taking pleasure in none of these things. He made a personal visitation
of his bishopric every year, and confirmed many Christians, sending
word beforehand, that the ministers might prepare those who were to
receive this holy sacrament. He gave much to his church and to his
convent of Manila, in spite of the poverty of his bishopric, but gave
very little help to a poor brother of his. In the province of
Pangasinan he gave great alms, and sent a large sum of money to buy
rice to be kept on deposit, as it were, in the cities, and to be
distributed in times of famine. He spent but little upon the persons of
his household, directing them to eat as he did, twice a day, eggs and
fish, and to be clothed plainly as suited ecclesiastical persons. He
lived in such poverty that he sometimes lacked tunics to make a change.
He was given to ejaculatory prayer. At the festival of Pentecost in the
year 1608, a dove lighted on his head, which he was unable to drive
away, the Lord thus showing him honor. In the following year, at the
celebration of this festival in Abulug the dove came and sat upon the
shoulder of the bishop. When the fever with which his last illness
began came upon him, he knew that his death <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>was
approaching. So far as he could, he followed the constitutions of the
order even in his sickness. After twenty-seven days of sickness, and
twenty-seven years of labor in these regions, his works were at an end,
and he went to receive the reward of them. In his last illness he gave
to the college of Sancto Thomas, at Manila, his library and three
thousand pesos.]</p>

<h3 class="main">Father Fray Francisco Minaio and his death</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[At this time the death of father Fray Francisco
Minaio was much regretted in the province. He was a native of Arevalo
in Castilla la Vieja. He assumed the habit and professed in Palencia,
and was sent to finish his studies in arts and theology to the convent
of Sancta Cruz at Segovia. He came to the province, very near its
beginning, with the bishop Don Fray Miguel de Benavides. He was
assigned to the province of Nueva Segovia, which was practically all
heathen. He labored much and with good results, and was stationed at
the utmost borders of the province, in the village of Pilitan. He
learned the language well, and was very devoted and compassionate to
the Indians. He labored most affectionately with the poor and sick, and
cared for the latter with his own hands. He and his associate, father
Fray Luis Flores, went about through all that region, searching for,
and burning the huts where superstitious sacrifices were offered to the
devil, who was consulted as an oracle in these places. These huts were
generally hidden among the mountains and crags in the midst of bushes.
The servants of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>God traveled over the rough paths, and all the
rest that they could take was in finding one of these huts and in
burning it. The devils were greatly angered by these insults; and the
Indians heard, in their fields, the complaints of the devil because
they believed in these men with white teeth. But they were obliged to
confess their weakness to the Indians, who in this way were converted
to the true faith. Father Fray Francisco, not contented with work in
these villages, began upon the conversion of the idolatrous tribes of
the great and spacious plains in the neighborhood of Pilitan, which are
known as Zimbuey. So diligent was he that churches were built on those
plains, and practically all were baptized and became good Christians.]
At one time when the father went to visit them he found one of the
principal chiefs of that country, named Guiab, lying sick. He talked
with him about matters of the faith and his salvation; and Guiab,
although he did not listen to them with displeasure, was still
unwilling to embrace them. Since his sickness was not at that time
severe, father Fray Francisco left him, telling him that if his disease
grew worse he should send for him. Father Fray Francisco returned to
his village of Pilitan. The sickness of Guiab increased in severity;
and the physicians who were there&mdash;perhaps the aforesaid
sorceresses&mdash;told him that the cure for his disease consisted in
killing a child and in bathing himself in its blood. He immediately
sent for the child; but so great was the respect which they had for
father Fray Francisco that, although they supposed that the life of
Guiab was departing, they were unwilling to put this order into
execution without first asking permission from the father, and sent for
some one to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>ask it. The father heard the message, and, without
letting the messengers return, went with them, fearing that even if he
refused his permission they would go on and kill the child. At this
same time Guiab heard, perhaps from the devil, that the father was
coming. He sent other messengers to say that there was no necessity of
the father&rsquo;s taking the trouble to go to the village; that if he
was not pleased that they should kill the child, they would not kill
it. This message reached the father while he was still on the way, but
he did not stop on that account, and kept on with all the rest. When he
entered the house of Guiab he found it full of people; and immediately
beheld there, weeping bitterly and hoarse with crying, the child who
was designed for the inhuman remedy which should slay its soul. Full of
pity, he told the sick man of the great error which he was committing,
and the frightful sin against God which would result; the uselessness
and unreasonableness of striving to obtain health for an old man by
bathing him in the blood of a child; the indignation of the Spaniards
if they should hear of this act; and the vengeance which they would
take for this unjust and cruel murder, if not upon his person, at least
upon his gold and treasure. Guiab admitted his error, and ordered the
child to be given to father Fray Francisco. In the course of the
father&rsquo;s conversation, Guiab received instruction as to matters
of the faith, which the father explained to him, taking as the
principle and subject of what he said the control of God our Lord over
the lives of men. The father took the child in his arms, and, on his
way back with him, he found a man tied fast to a ladder. This was the
father of the child, who was placed thus that he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>might
not interfere with the killing under the influence of his natural
paternal love. He had him untied, and left him in freedom and in great
happiness with his son. The sickness of Guiab was mortal, and the
father taught him thoroughly and baptized him. Following the directions
of the new Christian in his will, father Fray Francisco divided his
gold among his relatives, and gave liberty to many slaves whom he
wrongfully held. To the child whom the religious had ransomed (at the
price of six reals), he likewise gave baptism; and named him Feliz
[<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;fortunate&rdquo;], since he had been fortunate in
being rescued from the gates of eternal damnation, where he was already
standing, and placed by baptism in the beauty of grace and on the right
path for glory. [It could but be that the devil should burn with
infernal wrath against one who did so much against him; and that the
Lord should reward him, as He rewards His servants in this world, with
sufferings which result in their spiritual good. A bad man brought a
false accusation against father Fray Francisco of most nefarious
wickedness, and supported it with evidence so plausible that it seemed
as if the father must be guilty. The author of this charge exchanged a
religious letter which father Fray Francisco had written to his
superior, for a forged one very contrary to father Fray
Francisco&rsquo;s real manner of writing. In this way father Fray Luis
Gandullo, at that time vicar-provincial, was convinced of the truth of
the charge. The innocent man took this so much to heart that one day,
when he was saying mass before his Indians, he fainted and fell on the
floor, as if he were dead. The Indians fled from the church, in fear
that they should be charged with having <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>caused the death of their
minister. He was withdrawn from his ministry and placed in confinement;
but in the course of the trial the truth was made clear, and father
Fray Francisco was set free with honor. Some years afterward, he was
appointed prior of the convent at Manila, and afterward, was very
nearly elected provincial. He greatly augmented the devotion to our
Lady of the Rosary, and adorned her image with rich vestments and
jewels, and her chapel with a large retable and other ornaments. He was
not forgetful of the necessities of the poor, and greatly increased the
alms which were ordinarily given at the door of the convent. After he
had finished his term as prior, he returned to Nueva Segovia. When he
came back, the Indians, learning that their good father and teacher had
returned, came fifty leguas to visit him. The Lord gave him a peaceful
death, and he was buried in the church of our father Sancto Domingo at
Nueva Segovia.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The sufferings of the religious in Japon in the
persecution which arose against Christianity</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[The church in Japon was like the primitive church as
it was founded by our Lord, which from the beginning suffered
persecutions. The first persecutions of the church were not so severe
but that the disciples when persecuted in one city could flee to
another; thus, by sinking its roots deep, it was able to endure the
greater persecutions which followed in the days of the Neros and the
Domitians. All the persecutions in Japon up to the year 1614 were like
those in the infancy of the early church&mdash;tempered, and without
much shedding of blood; and giving the ministers an opportunity, when
they were expelled from one kingdom, to flee to another. That which
arose in this year was like the universal persecution of the church.
The emperor, seeing that it was impossible to cut off the trunk of
Christianity in Japon, and that to martyr a few would only give the
creed greater strength, decided (perhaps advised by the devil) that it
would be better and easier to cut off only the roots&mdash;namely, the
religious, by whose <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>teachings Christianity in Japon had been
brought into existence and was sustained. In the beginning of January
in this year he sent out an edict to all his tonos that the priests and
religious in their lands should be gathered together and sent to the
port of Nangasaqui, to the governor Safioye, to be put on board ship
and banished to Maccan or to Manila, so that not one should be left in
Japon. After this the rosaries, images, and other sacred objects were
to be taken from the Christians; and they were to be compelled to
worship idols, the disobedient being tortured and put to death. Great
care was to be taken that the bodies of the martyrs should not be
permitted to fall into the hands of the Christians, who might venerate
them. This decree was thoroughly carried out, and the Christians,
deprived of ministers and sacraments, went out of the cities and
fled&mdash;some to the mountains, others to caves, others to thick
woods; and others set sail in little boats for other countries. It made
the heart burn simply to hear the cruel destruction wrought by the
emperor among the faithful. Some were hung alive by one foot to high
trees; others were tied to stakes and exposed to the rigors of winter
by night and by day; the ears and the noses of others were cut off.
Others were branded on the brow with hot irons. Men and women were
being put to shame by being exposed naked, and chaste women were
threatened with being sent to the brothels. Some were put in sacks of
straw, dragged about the streets and derided; and others were hung up
in panniers and baskets. Others suffered confiscation of their goods,
and were banished, all people being forbidden to give them food or
lodging. These last were, for the most part, noble and rich persons
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>who had been brought up in luxury.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e503src" href="#xd21e503" name="xd21e503src">1</a>
The religious, laying aside their habits, went in secret throughout
Japon, animating and strengthening the persecuted Christians to suffer
for the Lord. Among these religious there were three of our order.</p>
<p>In this extremity of persecution confraternities were formed, for
the mutual support of their members. They took pledges to be faithful,
and were likely to be of great use because the Japanese, being a people
who think much of their honor, would be ashamed to lapse from such
agreements and promises. They made many processions, and subjected
themselves to severe disciplines. On the second of June, Safioye was
visited by all the superiors of the religious orders, whom he received
with courtesy and a great show of kindness. As soon as they had
returned to their convents, he sent them word from the emperor that
they should prepare all the members of their order to go to Macan or
Manila in the following autumn; and an inspector was sent to see that
the mandate was carried out. All the officials of the city of
Nangasaqui were compelled to sign a paper to the effect that they would
not conceal any religious or secular clergymen, or show them favor, or
assist them to remain in Japon. It was pitiful to see the Japanese
Christians as the time for the departure <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>of the religious
approached. On the fourteenth of October, our religious tore up the
crosses which had been erected, and burned them, together with other
things from the church, that they might not be profaned by the heathen.
After partaking of the holy sacrament on the following day, they put
out the lamps and left the altars. They put on board the ships the
relics and the bodies of the saints, and most of the ecclesiastical
ornaments and things from the sacristies, though of these they left
some to the Christians who were to remain in hiding. They were able to
take only a few of the bells. On the twenty-fifth, they were ordered to
leave the city for the port of Facunda, till their ships should be
ready. After they had set sail, certain priests returned in small
boats. There were five secular priests out of seven. Six of the ten
Franciscan priests remained, and seven out of the nine priests of our
order. Of three Augustinian fathers, one remained. Of seventy priests
of the Society, eighteen or twenty remained.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e510src" href="#xd21e510" name="xd21e510src">2</a> More would have
returned to land if it had not been for the failure of one of the boats
agreed upon. The names of the fathers who remained are given in all
cases, except in that of the Jesuits. After the departure of the
clergy, the profanation of the churches was begun. The fathers
disguised themselves as well as they could, and went out upon their
mission. Many of them were obliged to remain in Nangasaqui <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>and its
vicinity, because the greater number of Christians were there. They
traveled secretly, however, all over Japon. They labored chiefly at
night, and suffered greatly, being obliged to travel much, and lacking
food and sleep.]</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter II</h3>
<h3 class="main">Father Fray Francisco de San Joseph Blancas</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Though father Fray Francisco de San Joseph was not
one of the first founders of this province, he came in the second
shipload from Espa&ntilde;a. Because of his great virtue he is worthy
of an important place in this history. For this purpose it has pleased
God that there should come to my hands from the bishop of Monopoli, Don
Fray Juan Lopez, an accurate account of the first years of this father,
which follows. Father Fray Francisco was born at Tarazona in Navarra.
His parents were exceptionally pious. From his youth father Fray
Francisco showed signs of exceptional devotion. He fled from the sight
of women, and even declined to accompany his mother, excusing himself
on the ground of his studies. At the age of thirteen he was sent to
Alcala de Henares to continue his studies; and at the age of fifteen he
assumed the habit, and showed the behavior of a man at that youthful
age. An account is given of his sisters; and the testimony of persons
of superior virtue to the sanctity of father Fray Francisco is
cited.</p>
<p>In course of time he came to be reader of arts in the religious
convent of Piedrahita, where he was made master of the students. He had
even greater gifts as a preacher than as a teacher, having a fine
voice, natural rhetoric and powers of action, a great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>gift of
words, good memory, and skill in systematic arrangement. He was master
of the hearts of all those who heard him. His first pulpit was that of
San Antonino at Yepes, and later he was appointed as preacher to the
convent of Alcala. While here he felt the impulse to go to the
Philippinas, and, in spite of the efforts of the convent to retain him,
he carried out his purpose. When he reached Manila, his superiors,
desiring that the Spaniards of Manila might not be deprived of his
great talents as a preacher, assigned him to the ministry of Bataan,
which is near Manila. Here he learned the common language of the
Indians, called Tagal, so rapidly that he was able to preach in it
within three months, and taught others the language within six. He was
constantly studying the exact signification of the words of the
language and the method in which the Indians used them, so that he
might become a consummate master of this tongue.]</p>
<p>It is their custom when they are rowing their boats, or when many
are gathered together on any occasion, to sing in order to beguile and
relieve their labors. As they had no others, they used their old
profane and even pernicious songs. He composed many songs in their
language, after their own manner of verse, but on sacred
themes&mdash;for he had a particular gift for this&mdash;and introduced
these among them, so that they might use them on such occasions. He
hoped in this way to make them forget their old ballads, which were
useless or noxious, without taking from them their
pleasure&mdash;rather, indeed, to increase their delight by the devout
sentiments of the new songs. He wrote many books of devotion for them;
and since there was no printing in these islands, and no one who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>understood it or who made a trade of it, he
planned to have the printing done by means of a Chinaman, a good
Christian. This man, seeing that the books of father Fray Francisco
were sure to be of great use, bestowed so much energy upon this
undertaking that he finally succeeded with it. He was aided by some who
told him what they knew, and thus in time learned everything that was
necessary to do printing; and he printed these books.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e536src" href="#xd21e536" name="xd21e536src">3</a> [The good
father so delighted in seeing the fruit of his teaching among the
Indians that when he was directed to come back to the city, to preach
to the Spaniards, it was a severe penance for him. However, he did so,
especially in Lent. He was very severe in rebuking vice, and it gave
him pain to be obliged to preach to vicious Spaniards, as it seemed to
him that he was toiling in sterile soil. He usually came down from the
pulpit bathed in sweat, but continued to wear his heavy tunic and to
observe the rules of the order rigorously. Although he had seemed to be
of delicate constitution in Espa&ntilde;a, his health was always very
good, so that for more than twenty years during which he was in this
province he did not even have a headache, except once, when he struck
himself by accident. He spoke with intense energy, in a grave,
sententious, and clear manner. He learned the Chinese language, in
addition to the other two in which he preached; and he took as his
especial charge the duty of teaching the many negroes and slaves in
Manila. He was most humble, in spite of his great abilities. When he
was vicar-provincial of Manila, he received a letter from the
provincial, who was making a visitation <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>in the province of Nueva
Segovia. He asked father Fray Francisco, as vicar-provincial, to see if
some of the religious in his district could not be spared for that
needy region. Father Fray Francisco, thinking that he was himself the
least necessary person in the district of Manila, took with him one
father as his companion, and set out for Nueva Segovia. In the year
1614 he was sent to Espa&ntilde;a as procurator of the province, but
died on the voyage to Mexico. Just before and after his death his body
gave signs by the beauty of its appearance of the sanctity and purity
of his life. He printed a grammar of the Tagal language, and in that
language he printed a memorial of the Christian life, a book on the
four last things,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e544src" href="#xd21e544"
name="xd21e544src">4</a> another of preparation for the communion, a
treatise on confession, a book on the mysteries of the rosary of our
Lady, and another to teach the Tagal Indians the Spanish language. He
also left behind him many devout and valuable compositions in the
language of those Indians, particularly many sermons for Sundays and
saints&rsquo; days, which were highly regarded because of their
doctrine and their language, which is very elegant and pure. He had
also made a collection of sermons in the Spanish language for a whole
year, with the purpose of printing them. The letter of the dean and
chapter of the holy church of Manila (dated May 12, 1614), given him as
he was about to set out for Espa&ntilde;a, corroborates Aduarte&rsquo;s
account of him, and is therefore printed by that writer in full.]

<h3 class="label">Chapter III</h3>
<h3 class="main">Events in this province at this time</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the year 1615 this province, which from the
beginning had sailed with a fair wind, and had proceeded with the
conversions which it had undertaken in these Philippinas Islands
without meeting any storm, began to feel a hurricane which caused much
anxiety and pain. It was of great value in teaching the religious to
open their eyes, and to know that in dealing with heathen and new
converts they should not be content with the simplicity of the dove,
but should strive to add the wisdom of the serpent, as our Lord charged
His disciples and His preachers. Seven years only had passed since the
village named Batavag, which is the furthest village in the province of
Nueva Segovia, had been formed by assembling a population of
mountaineers. Many of these were still heathen; while the adult
Christians (who were the minority in the village) had been educated in
their idolatries, and therefore had not completely rooted out from
their hearts their ancient customs. Thus in time of sickness the former
priestesses of the devil, or witches, found their way into many of
their hearts. These women, coveting payment, came to offer on the part
of the devil, health to the sick if they would observe the ancient
superstitions which he had taught them. These sorceresses killed
certain birds, anointed the sick with their blood, practiced other
superstitious ceremonies which the devil accepted as a sacrifice, and
performed other similar acts. Some sick persons were guilty of these
things in their desire for health, not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>giving heed, since they
were not firmly rooted in the faith, to the grave offense which in this
way they were committing against God, the author of life and health;
and not considering the injury to the faith or the serious harm to
their own souls and consciences, which would follow. Yet their
condition was such that they ought to have considered this matter all
the more carefully, as the death that they feared brought them nearer
to the time when an account of all this would be demanded from them. If
the evil had been confined to this village, it would not have been very
great, because Batavag was small and had not a very large population,
and a majority of the adults were not yet Christian; but the evil
spread to other villages which were larger and older in the faith, such
as Bolo, Pilitan, and Abuatan, each of which had two thousand
inhabitants or more. Hence the matter was of greater importance, and
caused more anxiety to the ministers and preachers of the law of God.
When they received information as to what was occurring, they went with
great secrecy to make an investigation into the evil; and they wrote
down the names of the old aniteras or witches, in whom was the whole
foundation of this sin. One of the persons who took part in this
investigation warned the guilty old women in the village of Batavag;
and they, to escape the punishment which they feared, began to stir up
the inhabitants of that village. When the religious went there with the
purpose of remedying one evil, they found another greater one; for the
people of the village of Batavag were in tumult and alarm because of
what the witches had said to them, and had determined to flee to their
mountains and their ancient dwelling-places. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>had been
brought to the one that they now had, that they might be more easily,
and more to the profit of their souls, taught and baptized and given
the sacraments, in sickness and in health; for so long as they were
divided as they had been, into tiny hamlets at great distances from
each other, it was impossible to do that. But being (as at this time
they were) disturbed and alarmed by the witches, and desirous of
abandoning the faith, they returned to their ancient sites, which more
readily permitted each one to live in the law which he preferred, and
none in that which would have been well for him. Yet, in spite of all
this, the religious had dealt so well with them, and had shown them so
much love and benevolence, that the Indians could not cease to feel and
to show kindness for them. Hence, though they were able to kill the
religious or to do them any harm they pleased, because the fathers were
alone among them without any other protection than their good
consciences&mdash;which is a great safeguard&mdash;the Indians not only
did them no harm, but laid hands on nothing of theirs or of their
convent. This was, as it were, a declaration that they had fled, not on
account of any harm that the ministers had done them, but on account of
their fear of the punishment which their bad consciences caused them to
dread&mdash;a fear increased by what the aniteras or witches, as the
most guilty, had falsely said to them with the purpose of alarming
them. In point of fact, the religious had had no idea of severe
punishment, but simply of remedying such pernicious evils. They pitied
them as being new in the faith, and pitied even the very witches as
being persons deceived by the devil, little exercised in the law of
God, and many of them not even baptized. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>The religious were
greatly grieved by this event, and carried down to the nearest village
the adornments of the church which they had there, taking with them
some Indians who feared God and did not wish to follow the pernicious
behaviour of those who fled from God to the devil. They made some
efforts to bring back with kindness those who had fled; and in this way
some of them, enlightened by God, returned to the bosom of the Church
and the easy yoke of the divine law. They made continual efforts to
bring back the rest, declining no labor, no journeys, and no
discomforts, in order to gain some soul from among these lost ones. The
flight of these Indians took place on the day of the ascension of the
Lord, May 28. Since they had retired into the mountains, the Spaniards,
as they were few, did not pursue them, deeming that on account of the
roughness of the country where they were the pursuit would have little
effect, and would cause many deaths, much suffering, and great expense.
Hence many of them remained apostates from the faith and the baptism
which they received, which is a cause of great grief.</p>
<p>On the nineteenth of the following month in the same year, ships
arrived from Mexico with thirty-two religious to aid in the work of
conversion upon which this province was engaged. On the following day,
Saturday, in the morning, they entered the convent, to the great joy of
themselves and of those who dwelt in it. Their vicar and superior from
Mexico hither had been father Fray Angel Ferrer,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e566src" href="#xd21e566" name="xd21e566src">5</a> who was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>afterward a glorious martyr in Japon. When this
company of religious arrived in Mexico, he was vicar of the convent of
San Jacintho, which this province has near that noble city, as a
hospice for the religious who come to it from Espa&ntilde;a. Since he
who was conducting them [<i>i.e.</i>, Aduarte] went back thither,
father Fray Angel undertook the very useful duty of conducting them to
the Philippinas, in order that the former might fulfil his office as
procurator of the province. The Lord led him, without his knowing it,
that He might give him a glorious martyr&rsquo;s crown, which he
received a few years afterward, as will be told later.</p>
<p>These religious reached Mexico in the year 1613. Since in that year
there had been no ships from the Philippinas, it was necessary to
detain them there until the following year, with great risk that those
who were coming to these islands might remain in that kingdom, which
has so attractive a climate and is so abundant in all things; but as
these fathers did not come to seek for pleasures, but for the souls of
their fellow-men and labors for themselves, it was not hard to overcome
this and other difficulties which were met. To this good result the
excellent administration of the superiors greatly contributed, and the
constant occupation of the friars in holy exercises, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>prayer,
fasting, and disciplines. Thus they not only prevailed against the
temptations of ease and comfort, but were prepared so that the Lord
might raise them to higher things&mdash;some of them even to the glory
of martyrdom, which, as St. Augustine says, is the greatest glory of
the church.</p>
<p>[In order to inspire in them a longing for these things, the Lord
gave them grace in the meantime to save some lost souls. Two notable
cases of this sort occurred, one in Cadiz and the other in Mexico. Two
of them rescued and returned to her convent, a wretched woman, eighteen
years old, whom a dissolute lieutenant had enticed from a convent in
Xerez. In Mexico there was a wretched man, a person of acute intellect
and learning, who had been guilty of an infamous crime with a boy. He
had refused to confess, and, when he was tortured, had charged a number
of innocent persons with complicity with his foul actions. The
president of the alcaldes de corte [<i>i.e.,</i> &ldquo;judges of the
high court&rdquo;] was at this time Dr. Morga, who had a very kind
feeling for the religious of this province, since he had come to know
them by his long residence here as an auditor. By his assistance, and
by that of one of the officers of the prison, father Fray Pedro Muriel
obtained access to this unfortunate man; and by his wise and kindly
conferences softened his heart, so that he confessed his original guilt
and also his malice in making false charges against innocent persons.
Both before and after his execution, there were manifest signs that the
Lord had been pleased to grant him salvation. In the following year,
1616, father Fray Bernardo de Sancta Catalina, or Navarro, commissary
of the Holy Office in these islands, and one of the first founders
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>of the province, was a second time elected
provincial. In the following month, at a feast of the Visitation, there
died in the city of Nueva Segovia father Fray Garcia Oroz, a Navarrese
by nation; he was a son of the convent of our Lady of Atocha in Madrid,
and a religious old in virtue as in years. When he made his first
efforts to come to the province he had been hindered, but afterward
carried out his intention; and although, because of his years, he was
unable to learn the language, he was of great use to his companion who
understood it, by his assistance and by the good example of his
life.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The life and death of father Fray Bernardo de Sancta
Cathalina, or Navarro</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[The new provincial had but a short time in which he
could exercise his office, as he died in November of the same year, on
the octave of All Saints. Father Fray Bernardo was a native of
Villanueva de la Xara. He was much inclined from his earliest years to
letters and the Church; he assumed the habit in the convent of Sancta
Cruz at Villaescusa. After he had professed, he was sent to study in
the college of Sancto Thomas at Alcala, which was the highest honor
that the convent could bestow on a student. Here he so distinguished
himself that the college gave him charge of the conduct of a
theological discussion in the provincial chapter, which is the highest
honor that a college can give its theologues. While at the college, he
did not take advantage of the privilege of eating meat, which is
granted to students in consideration of their labors and study. He was
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>successful and beloved preacher, and lived a life
of the severest mortification. He was most devoted to the holy
sacrament. At one time when a sick person had received the Lord and had
afterward vomited forth the sacramental species, which was carelessly
swept into a rubbish-heap, father Fray Bernardo rescued the precious
treasure. He was most successful in uprooting the vices of the villages
in Espa&ntilde;a where he preached. When he came to this province he
was one of the best of the ministers, and one of those who labored in
the conversion of these tribes with the greatest results. He was
assigned to be superior of the religious who preached to the barbarian
Indians in Pangasinan&mdash;an indomitable, untamed, and bloody race;
and above measure opposed to the gospel, since that was above measure
opposed to their vices, cruelties, lewdnesses, superstitions, and
idolatries. Noble religious were his companions, eager to act and to
suffer for the conversion of souls; but father Fray Bernardo was the
head and superior of these religious, the one who first began to
succeed in christianizing those Indians, the one who perfected them and
carried them on to a high state of Christian excellence. His life and
his doctrine were alike marvelous and efficacious in influencing the
souls of those Indians. He was devoted to his charge, seeking alms from
the Spaniards for his Indians, and defending them with all his might
from the wrongs which were committed against them. It was only in
defense of his Indians that he was seen to give up his ordinary
gentleness of demeanor, which was like that of a dove. The Lord blessed
his efforts for the conversion of those Indians by miraculous healing
wrought by his hands. He was visited by the saints, in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>particular by our father St. Dominic and St.
Vincent Ferrer, who were seen to come and say matins with him. He was
given miraculous insight into the souls of those who confessed to him;
was miraculously preserved from fire and water; and had power given him
to see devils who had taken possession of those who were confessing to
him, or whom he desired to convert. It was declared that he even had a
vision of the holy Virgin. He lived a life of abstinence, penance, and
the greatest devotion; and translated into the Indian language a
hundred and fifty brief devout treatises. He also wrote in their
language a number of spiritual letters, afterward collected by father
Fray Melchior Pavia, who made a goodly volume of them that they might
serve as an example of the manner to be followed, in writing to the
Indians, by the religious who came after. In temporal matters he
likewise assisted those Indians in all ways in his power; for in
addition to their poverty they were his dearest sons, engendered in
Christ with mighty but successful labors.</p>
<p>Although father Fray Bernardo would have been pleased to be left
forever among his Indians, the province felt that it had need of him
for higher duties, and elected him as provincial in 1596. He gave a
noble example as head of the province, and was most wise, kind, and
prudent in his visitations. At one time, finding it necessary to
chastise one of his subordinates, he began the punishment upon himself,
compelling the guilty person to scourge him severely while they two
were alone. Then he proceeded to scourge the man who was in fault, who,
considering what had preceded, received his chastisement with great
humility and amended his life. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64"
href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>fervent love of God of father
Fray Bernardo was manifest in all that he said and did. The high esteem
in which he was held spread from the Philippinas to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, so that the tribunal of the Holy Office in Mexico made
him its commissary-general in all these islands. On some occasions he
showed the gift of prophecy, foretelling the deaths of some persons, or
declaring the deaths of those who were at a distance. Once when a
governor assembled a great fleet against the Dutch enemies, he was
obliged to obtain the necessary revenue by great oppression of the
Indians and the poor, since the royal treasury did not yield a
sufficient amount for the undertaking. Father Fray Bernardo was greatly
grieved by this course of procedure, and strove to remedy it without
success. When the governor was about to set out, father Fray Bernardo
declared to him that he would never return; and, in point of fact, he
died in Malaca without ever seeing the enemy.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e608src" href="#xd21e608" name="xd21e608src">6</a> The persecution
in Japon was revealed to him before it occurred. Being asked how he
knew of the threatening danger, he said that he inferred it from
certain stars in the sky, which resembled a comet threatening Japon.
His companion when he had looked was unable to see any comet, or
anything like one. His love and charity kept constantly increasing, and
there were continually on his lips the words, &ldquo;Let us love God;
let us love God.&rdquo; He sent what he could to the needy and
persecuted Christians in Japon, and wrote to Mexico to get such
assistance for them as he could obtain. He was always most loving and
kindly to all the religious. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the end of his term as provincial, he would have been glad to
live and die among his children in Pangasinan, but was detained in
Manila by his duties as commissary of the Holy Office. Yet every year
he used to make a visit to Pangasinan, where he was received as an
angel from heaven, and sometimes carried almost by force to distant
villages, by Indians who came more than twenty leguas for the purpose.
His arrival was like a feast-day. The people crowded to confess to him,
and to listen to his spiritual exhortations. They put off the
settlement of their most weighty differences to submit them to his
judgment. They sometimes crowded about him to kiss his hand or his
scapular so that he could not move. When he was a second time elected
as provincial, his devotion to the duties of his office resulted in his
death. The stormy weather preventing him from going by sea to Nueva
Segovia, he made the journey by land, traveling through the swamps and
lowlands of Yllocos<a class="noteref" id="xd21e617src" href="#xd21e617"
name="xd21e617src">7</a> and over the Caraballos, some rough and lofty
mountains, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>where he was caught by a baguio or hurricane. The
rivers rose so that he was unable to go on. Captain Pedro de Rojas, his
son in the faith, had gone with him to keep him company. The hardships
of their journey were such that both men fell sick; and father Fray
Bernardo, in fear of immediate death, kept praying to the Lord that he
would prolong his life until they reached a place where he could
receive the sacraments. Arriving in Abulug, Captain Pedro de Rojas was
given up by the physician; but the father, in spite of his advanced
age, seemed likely to recover. He was deeply grieved that he&mdash;who
was of no use in the world, as he said&mdash;should be saved, while the
captain had given up his life simply to accompany him. He prayed the
Lord that he might change places with the captain, who soon afterward
began to amend; while father Fray Bernardo within twenty-four hours
fell sick again in Camalayugan, and felt that his disease was mortal.
On the eighth of November, the octave of All Saints, he departed from
this vale of tears, to be with those who are in glory. His death caused
great grief in Pangasinan and Manila. Double honors were shown to him
in our convent, first as provincial, and second as commissary-general
of the Holy Office. At the latter service father Fray Antonio Gutierrez
preached, recounting much of what has here been written. After his
death, a religious had a vision of his soul going to glory. In the
provincial chapter in the following year, honorable mention is made of
father Fray Bernardo in a Latin eulogy, recording his illustrious
virtues, his marvelous success in the conversion of the province of
Pangasinan, and the sacrifice of his life to the duties of his office.]

<h3 class="main">The election as provincial of father Fray Melchior
Man&ccedil;ano, and the situation in Japon at this time.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the sad news of the death of the provincial was
learned, the electors assembled at Binalatongan, a village of
Pangasinan, on the fifteenth of April, 1617, and elected as head and
superior of the province father Fray Melchior de
Man&ccedil;ano,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e636src" href="#xd21e636"
name="xd21e636src">8</a> who was at that time vicar of the convent of
the city of Nueva Segovia. He was a very prudent and devout character,
a professed son of the convent of the order in Oca&ntilde;a; and had
been made, on account of his great ability and his successful studies,
a theologue at the college of Sancto Thomas at Alcala. In this province
he had governed many of the best convents with great approbation; and
his term as provincial was very useful to the province, augmenting it
greatly, as will be narrated.</p>
<p>[Now that the churches in all Japon were torn down and all the
priests expelled, as Safioye supposed, it seemed to him time to begin
the persecution of Christianity. The commencement was made in the
kingdom of Arima, which was under the direct government of the emperor.
The officers <i>upon</i> whom was laid the carrying out of this
persecution did their work with cruelty and insolence. When the news of
the beginning of the persecution reached Figen, twenty courageous
Japanese went from Nangasaqui to Arima to confess the faith, and died a
glorious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>martyrdom. Some others who purposed to follow in
their footsteps had not the courage, and recanted when they saw the
dreadful torment which awaited them. As soon as father Fray Thomas del
Espiritu Sancto, or Zumarraga, the vicar-provincial of our religious
who were in hiding, heard of this persecution in Arima, he despatched
father Fray Jacintho Orfanel to go to the aid of the persecuted
Christians, and soon afterward sent father Fray Juan de Los Angeles
Rueda to go thither also. They were followed by the father commissary
of the Order of St. Francis, with three other religious of his order.
The efforts of the religious in hearing confessions, giving the
sacraments, and comforting and strengthening the persecuted Christians,
were of great value. It seemed unwise, however, to enter the city of
Arima itself, where guards had been set to prevent entrance and egress;
for if the emperor should learn that any religious had remained in
Japon, the persecution was likely to be very much more severe. The
Christians in Nangasaqui prepared themselves, and were prepared by the
religious, for the beginning of the persecution in that city. When
everything was ready, the persecution was suspended on account of a war
between the emperor and Fideyori, the son of the previous emperor and
the true heir to the throne.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e646src" href=
"#xd21e646" name="xd21e646src">9</a> The <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>officers contented
themselves with publicly burning a great number of rosaries, crosses,
and other Christian emblems taken from Arima. Father Fray Alonso
Navarrete had assumed the dress of a Spanish layman and was beaten for
trying to rescue from the fire some rosaries. Our religious obtained
the sacred relics of a number of the blessed martyrs. The emperor was
victorious over Fideyori by treachery. During the progress of the war
the Christians had peace; and the fathers did a mighty work in
strengthening their courage, and in perfecting them in the faith. Many,
however, of the Christians, for the lack of ministers, had begun to
forget the matters of the faith and even their own Christian names.
Some of the Franciscan fathers were captured, and thrown into prison;
but the fathers of our order escaped. After the fall of Usaca and the
disastrous close of the war, the persecution broke out again. The
fathers were scattered among various kingdoms, but were prevented, by
the very close watch which was kept, from entering Satzuma. The father
vicar-provincial alone, with father Fray Francisco de Morales and
father Fray Joseph, remained in Nangasaqui, going out at night only, in
secular dress. This lasted until the death of the emperor, in the year
1616. Nangasaqui being the metropolis of Christianity in Japon, where
the number of Christians was greatest and their spirit resolved and
determined, the emperor did not dare to treat the Christians there with
as much severity as elsewhere. In spite of the exposure of our
ministers in Japon, not one of the members of our order died a natural
death, but all were crowned with the crown and aureole of martyrdom.]

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[In the beginning of the year 1616, the confraternity
of our Lady of the Rosary, which had been established in 1602, when the
order of our father St. Dominic entered Japon, was very greatly
increased, and the devotion to the rosary became much more intense.
This order and the devotion connected with it spread from Nangasaqui
through all parts of Japon, and much improvement in the lives of those
who devoted themselves to the rosary was perceived. Miraculous strength
was also given to the members of the confraternity to hold to their
faith. In July the emperor died by poison, which was given him by
mistake from a box of medicine. The emperor being succeeded by his son,
Xogunsama,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e665src" href="#xd21e665" name=
"xd21e665src">10</a> the persecution was continued, and even increased
in severity, the officers exerting themselves to invent ingenious
tortures. Sometimes the very tormentors themselves, though they did not
abandon their idolatry, were compelled by the virtue of the martyrs,
and the aid rendered them by the Lord, to admit the truth of our holy
faith. Particulars are given of the deaths of a number of martyrs. In
course of time the persecution extended to Nangasaqui. It was
discovered by accident that there were religious in the city. This was
one cause for the beginning of the persecution. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>Another
cause was the contentions of two governors in the city, one Christian

Order of St. Francis, and Father Juan Baptista Tavora of the Society,
were caught and suffered martyrdom, being decapitated May 22, 1617.
This caused great joy among the religious, who had feared that, if they
should be captured, they would merely be sent out of the kingdom, but
were now encouraged to hope for the crown of martyrdom.]</p>

<p class="first">[The two fathers set out, traveling slowly,
encouraging the Christians and recovering some of those who had

and the religious heard their confessions at the risk of their lives.
The fathers rejoiced to lay aside their secular garments; and the
Christians who saw them in religious habits were greatly delighted.
Five persecutors came to arrest the fathers, who received them with
great joy and gave them presents. Father Fray Alonso wrote a letter to
the tono, informing him that the fathers had come to give him an
opportunity to repent of his great sin in martyring the fathers who had
been executed, and to deliver him from the pains of hell. Some Japanese
boldly offered themselves for martyrdom. The Christian inhabitants of
the city showed the greatest devotion to the fathers, crowding about
them and offering themselves for martyrdom with them; and they showed
the greatest grief at the thought that the fathers were to be taken
from them by death. The tono of Omura was in the greatest grief and
perplexity, feeling that there would fall on him the obligation to
martyr Christians after Christians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73"

themselves in his kingdom. He finally determined to take their lives,
but with the greatest secrecy, in order to prevent an uprising in the
city. The fathers were accordingly taken to a desolate island named
Usuxima; and in spite of the efforts of the heathen to keep the place
secret, they were followed by a great number of Christians, who
confessed to them.]</p>

religious to Japon at any cost. In spite of the care of the tyrant,
some Christians were present at the execution. The two were beheaded on
Thursday, the first of June, the octave of Corpus Christi. Their very
executioners looked upon them at such men of virtue that they dipped
their handkerchiefs and bits of paper in their sacred blood, to keep
these as relics. The bodies of all the martyrs were put in coffins
laden with stones, and cast into the sea. In spite of the danger, many
Japanese went to the place of the martyrdom to venerate the relics of
these saints; and the Confraternity of the Rosary offered continual
prayers that they might recover the bodies of these holy martyrs. At

<p class="first">[The holy Fray Hernando was especially devoted to the
souls in purgatory, and gave a notable example of poverty and obedience
to the rules of his order. Father Fray Alonso was very pious,
almsgiving, and compassionate. Although the lords in Japon are very
rich, the poor people are very needy; so that the heathen often slay
their new-born children, and the Christians cast them out in the
street. The heart of the holy man was so afflicted by this that, at his
persuasion, a Spanish captain named Pablo Carrucho settled a certain
income upon the pious work of maintaining these children. Just before
his death the holy martyr, not forgetful of this, wrote a letter to the
captain, urging him not to forget the alms for the exposed children.
Father Fray Alonso was one of the first ministers of Nueva Segovia; he
returned to Europe, to bring with him a number of new religious to the
Philippinas. After he had been assigned to Japon he once returned to
the Philippinas. He suffered greatly in these voyages, since he was of
delicate constitution. He was a charitable and most beloved minister,
very bold, and especially distinguished for his gratitude. From this
martyrdom the Christians of Nangasaqui received new courage, as did
also those of Omura, who were greatly strengthened in the faith. Some,
indeed, who had feared to do so before, boldly confessed Christianity.
Throughout Japon the example of this martyrdom was a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>great
source of strength to the Christians, and forced the heathen to respect
the Christian faith. The heathen also were cured of their error of
supposing that the fathers had come to this region because of temporal
ambitions. The persecution which was feared in Nangasaqui ceased when
the courage of the holy men was seen. The last result of this martyrdom
was the many more martyrdoms, which soon followed, of those who by the
example of these saints openly avowed Christianity. The names of
several of the confessors and martyrs are given, with a brief account

<h3 class="main">The building of the church of Los Sanctos Reyes in the
Parian</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As soon as the order entered these islands, it took
upon itself the charge of evangelizing and teaching the Chinese who
came to these islands, every year, in pursuit of their business and
profit. They all lived in a sort of alcaicer&iacute;a, or market,
called in this country a Parian; and here there were usually ten
thousand Chinese, and at times as many as twenty thousand. Here they
not only store their merchandise, which is very rich, but maintain all
the trades required for a very well ordered and provided community.
They were at that time all heathen, because up to that time as soon as
any Chinaman was converted and baptized he was obliged to leave this
idolatrous place and to go to live in another village, of baptized
Chinese, which was near there. In this way the effort was made to
separate the newly-baptized from the heathen, so that they might not
follow the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>bad example of their heathen neighbors while their
Christianity, being new, had not sufficient strength to resist this
temptation and free themselves from the danger of this scandal. The
town of the heathen was not forgotten on this account; for the
religious went from the town of the Christian Chinese, called Binondoc,
where they lived, to preach every Sunday to those who lived in the
Parian. This course was followed up to the year 1617, when it was
remarked, with reason, how advantageous it would be that preachers
should be constantly in residence in this multitude of people. Thus by
having more intercourse with them, and being in closer relations with
them, they might reap a greater spiritual harvest among the Chinese,
and the number of those who should be baptized, in both sickness and
health, might be greatly increased. The father provincial conferred
with the two estates, ecclesiastical and secular, receiving the
approval of everyone. The usual licenses were obtained, and a small
wooden church and convent were begun. Everything was done at the
expense of the order, that it might not be necessary to ask anything
from the heathen Chinese, for whose benefit and advantage the buildings
were erected. The Lord straightway began to manifest that the work was
very acceptable to Him, by showing marvelous favor to a Chinaman who
was occupied as overseer of the building. A Spaniard, enraged because
he had been bitten by a dog, asked the Chinaman &ldquo;whose dog that
was,&rdquo; intending to avenge upon the owner the pain which the dog
had caused him. The Chinaman answered that he did not know whose it
was, and the angry Spaniard said: &ldquo;It must be yours, because you
do not tell me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78"
name="pb78">78</a>]</span>Drawing his sword he thrust it at his chest;
but the Lord, who was pleased with the care which the Chinaman gave to
the building of His poor temple, guided the sword so that it struck an
ebony cross which the Chinaman wore under his clothes. The blow made a
deep mark upon this cross, while the Chinaman was untouched&mdash;the
Lord receiving the thrust upon His own cross that it might not harm His
votary. The Chinaman recognized this as a very special mercy, and a
great reward for his labor; and he and all those who knew of the fact
praised the Lord, wonderful in His works.</p>
<p>The poor church was finished, and being the edifice of those vowed
to poverty it lasted but a short time. The beams which served as
columns and held up the building were not strong, and the soil was
marshy and unstable; hence the beams were unable to carry the load of
the tiling, but gave way, in such a manner as to threaten the downfall
of the church. To prevent this, so that no one might be caught beneath,
it was planned to take down the tiling; and while the church was being
untiled, and there were nineteen persons on the roof, the building
(which was already on the point of falling) broke open with this
additional weight, and the whole roof came down&mdash;key-beams,
ridge-pole, and tiles. Even some of the largest beams were broken into
very small fragments; and many of those who were on the peak of the
roof were caught and buried in the lumber and tiles, so that of some
there was nothing to be seen except some part of their clothing. A
great multitude of people ran to the noise. Most of them were heathen,
and stood looking on with much alarm at the ruin which had been
wrought; but they did not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href=
"#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>dare to show any kindness, or to
disinter the poor workmen who had been overwhelmed. Hence the men
remained for a long space of time covered in this way, all supposing
that they were not only dead, but horribly mangled. However, this was
not the case; for the Lord was desirous of teaching these heathen the
omnipotence of His providence and the care that He takes of those who
serve Him; and all were taken out, unconscious indeed, but uninjured
and in health, without the slightest wound upon any one of them,
although some very heavy key-beams had been broken to pieces. They soon
came to themselves and gave thanks to Him who had so marvelously
preserved them; while all those present, who were innumerable, both
Christians and heathen, were astonished, and the heathen said aloud:
&ldquo;Great is the providence of the God of the Christians.&rdquo;
Thus the Lord drew from these His enemies the highest praises, and
changed into honor to His name that which might have caused offense
among these idolaters if these men had been killed while working on the
house of God. It was believed that the fervent prayer of father Fray
Bartholome Martynez aided much in bringing about this result; for the
work was going on under his direction, and when he saw that a good
account of it could not be given, if the Lord did not remedy this
misfortune, he begged this grace of Him most affectionately. And this
was not the only time when the Lord granted to his faithful and devout
prayers very marvelous things, as will be narrated in due time.</p>
<p>A small portion of the land belonging to the convent was made ready
to serve, as well as possible, for a tiny church for the few Christians
who were there. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>The harvest reaped here by the religious, in this
multitude of heathen and idolatrous people, was marvelous. They taught
them constantly by day and night in the church, in the squares, in
their houses, without losing an opportunity to do them
good&mdash;though they labored beyond their strength, trusting in the
Lord whose work they were doing. Marvelous results immediately
followed, to the great service and honor of the Lord and the profit of
souls. Of the many sick in the Parian, who before the residence of the
fathers had all departed in their heathen state, now, since they have
had these devoted fathers among them and have heard their teaching,
practically none have died without being baptized. Such is the fruit of
the fathers&rsquo; care in expounding the faith to them, explaining to
them the great good and the spiritual benefit of baptism, and the
eternal misery of those who have neglected it. Often even the heathen
relatives and friends of the sick have persuaded them to be baptized;
and they, like the persons of their own nation whom the fathers have
appointed for that purpose, take great care to ascertain if there are
any sick, and to inform the fathers, that the latter may visit them and
teach them the way to heaven.</p>
<p>In addition to these who are baptized in sickness, many are baptized
in health and take back the news of the gospel to their own country. In
this way, it is hoped, the entry of preachers into China will be
somewhat facilitated, if it is once known that we are persons who, in
addition to loving and helping them, are not desirous for our temporal
profit, but for the good of their souls. This is an argument of great
weight with the Chinaman, who is excessively avaricious, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>and
hence regards as a very divine virtue the contempt of that which he
esteems so highly. Since they are very intelligent, they are easily
persuaded that that is truth which we preach to them as to the great
reward in the other life for those who are good, since they see that
their preachers take such pains and undergo such penances to become
good, and despise all temporal gain in the firm hope of an eternal one.
If their eternal reward were not to be much the vaster, great would be
their imprudence to cast aside for it all temporal reward; and they
would be, as the apostle has said, of all men most miserable.</p>
<p>Father Fray Bartholome Martynez afterward erected on the same site a
sumptuous and handsome church, which was intentionally made large and
capacious, that there might be room in it for the many whom he hoped to
baptize; and beautiful, that the very magnificence of the edifice might
give some sign by its appearance of whose it was. In order that it
might please the Chinese better, it was constructed entirely after the
manner of the best buildings in China, out of wood, the pieces framed
together with joints, without any nails in the entire frame. This was
accomplished, in spite of the fact that the number of pieces which
entered into the frame came to more than three thousand. They were
wrought with marvelous skill, and with superior craftsmanship; indeed,
before they began to be put in place they were all shaped, with their
joints so fitted that, although the architect at the time of erecting
the building happened to be unable on account of illness to rise from
his bed, and had to give his directions from it as to what had to be
done, yet everything was found to be so exact that his presence was not
needed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>Everything was fitted exactly as it was planned
and worked out by the designer from the beginning. This is something
which aroused great admiration in the Spanish architects who saw it,
and they were amazed, and with reason. It is reckoned a matter worthy
of the wisdom given by God to Solomon that the same thing is recounted
of the temple which he built, as is narrated in holy scripture. The
architect was a heathen, very old and infirm; but God prolonged his
life until this work was finished. Afterward, as his illness grew
worse, he asked for holy baptism; and, having received it devoutly, he
died happy in being a Christian, and was buried in the church which he
had built for God.</p>
<p>[While the church was being built, some very notable events
happened. One Sunday, after the Christians had heard mass, they and a
number of heathen who helped them were dragging a very large beam which
was to serve as a column in the building. As they went down a little
hill, it began to roll on some round sticks which they had placed under
it in order that they might move it with less difficulty, and came at
one of those who were dragging it with such force that, as it seemed,
he could in no way avoid being caught by it. The Lord heard the prayers
of some religious who were present, and delivered him from his danger.
In the same church the workmen were setting up the beams which were to
support the four corners of the transept like columns&mdash;which beams
were much larger, longer, and thicker than any of the others. A great
number of people were stationed on each of the four sides of one, to
draw it so that it might go straight. The cables which they used were
new and heavy, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span>there was a workman seated on the head of the
beam to watch the hitches of the cables to be sure that they did not
slip. The weight of the beam was so great that one of the cables gave
way, and when it was broken the others began to become loose. The
workmen dropped their work and fled in alarm, leaving the man on the
head of the beam beyond help, as it seemed. Father Fray Bartholome
Martinez prayed to the Lord for this man, and the beam rested upon some
bamboos standing there, which were strong, but not strong enough to
carry such a weight; and the man got down by them unhurt, but with his
blood curdled by fright. The church was finished and was most
beautiful, being a notable piece of work in its style. It caused great
joy to the Spaniards, and to the Chinese, both Christian and heathen.
In the course of time another event which greatly edified these Chinese
occurred; for on Monday, March 13, 1628, at one o&rsquo;clock at night,
a fire broke out in the Parian which burnt down practically the whole
of it&mdash;since it was at that time built of reeds and nipa, or of
dry boards, which burn like a torch. The only houses saved were some
which were protected by green trees, and some other small ones which
were somewhat isolated. The fire bore directly toward the church, and
had already begun to scorch the wood of it, when the religious carried
out the image of our Lady of the Rosary, and turned her face toward the
fire. The wind instantly changed, and the church was saved. Although in
the construction of this most beautiful church care had been taken to
build it of durable wood, yet within a few years some of it rotted, and
it seemed as if it would be with this church as with the others. Hence
it was deemed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>necessary to tear it down, for fear of accident;
and another church was built, with strong pillars of stone.] Since this
is very near the city, we did not fail to build it with stronger frame.
But it is very beautifully decorated, its walls being covered from top
to bottom with paintings, in which is depicted everything which may
instruct these heathen in the knowledge of that which is of consequence
for them to understand. There is represented the whole life of Christ
our Lord, and His most holy Mother; there are many pictures of the
judgment, purgatory, glory, and hell; much instruction as to the seven
holy sacraments; many miracles pertaining to them, and especially to
the greatest of all; many martyrs, and many holy examples. All this, in
addition to beautifying the church, is of great use, serving as devout
books wherein these people (who are very inquisitive) may see and
understand that which is taught to them by word of mouth; and very
great benefit is thus wrought for them. Many incidents have occurred
which have made clear the great usefulness of having this church in the
midst of this idolatrous population, to preach the true God with so
loud a voice that it may be heard in the great kingdom of China, and
may dispose it to be converted.</p>
<p>[One of those who had been baptized here was accused, when he
returned to his country, of being a Christian. When the Christian
replied that there was nothing evil in Christianity, the judge asked
him how he could say that being a Christian was not evil. He handed the
judge a little card printed in the Chinese language, containing the
first prayers, the ten commandments, and directions for works of
charity, and told him that this was the Christian law. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>The
judge, when he had read it over, dismissed the Chinaman, retaining the
card, and saying: &ldquo;Who has deceived me by saying that
Christianity is evil? On the contrary, it is very good.&rdquo; Thus the
knowledge of Christianity spreads in that great kingdom. The Lord
wrought miracles in defense of the new converts, punishing with death a
heathen who had insulted a Chinaman that had given up his litigious
habits after his baptism; and other miracles of healing and protection
were wrought, and marvelous conversions took place, evidently by the
hand of God.] There have been baptized in this church, from the year
1618, when baptisms began, up to the year 1633, when this is written,
four thousand seven hundred and fifty-two Chinese, all adults. Of
these, two thousand and fifty-five were baptized in health, and two
thousand six hundred and ninety-seven in sickness, in addition to some
whose names were accidentally omitted from the registry. Since that
time<a class="noteref" id="xd21e757src" href="#xd21e757" name=
"xd21e757src">12</a> baptisms have continued at a proportional rate,
where, before they had the church, all died in their idolatry, and
there were very few who went hence in health to be baptized in other
churches. Such persons usually went to our church in Minondo for the
Christians of their nation; but those who went from the Parian were
very few, because they did not at that time have the constant intimacy
and stimulus of the presence of the religious, as now. The result has
been a very great increase of the affection which the Chinese have
always felt for our order, and the high regard which they have for our
holy faith. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>This is so great that even the heathen, who
themselves are not baptized because of worldly considerations,
generally desire the sick with whom they are connected by relationship
or friendship to become Christians. Hence it is rare that anyone dies
in this great multitude of heathens without first being baptized; while
those who return to their great kingdom give in it a very good report
of our faith and of the doctrine of Christ, to the no small credit of
our religious community, with the members of which they generally have
most to do, and receive from them the greatest benefits, both in
spiritual and in temporal matters; for we are often able to be of
assistance to them. They recount all this in their own country; and
this is an excellent preparation for the rapid advance of the holy
gospel, which has already entered it.</p>

<h3 class="main">Some missions sent to various kingdoms</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Since the establishment of this province was intended
not only for the Philippinas, but also for the neighboring heathen
kingdoms, advantage was taken of every opportunity to send out
religious to these other kingdoms. Our order had planned to labor in
the conversion of the kingdom of Macasar, whose king manifested some
signs of desiring to have religious sent to him. This kingdom is very
powerful, and has a large population. The people of it have an
excellent natural disposition, which is a good foundation for the
faith; but, because of disturbances which arose, this mission did not
take effect.</p>
<p>The religious not only of this province, but of Espa&ntilde;a and
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, have had their hearts <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>set upon
the conversion of the kingdom of China, the population of which is of
incredible vastness, and the people there exhibit very acute
intelligence and have an excellent civilization and government. They
even establish their authority in all the neighboring kingdoms: Corea,
Siam, Camboja, Cochinchina, and others; and they communicate their
system to these as far as possible. Their character and their moral
doctrines also fit them for the gospel. In spite of the failure of
previous efforts to enter this kingdom, our religious were not
discouraged. In this year (<i>i.e.</i>, 1618) an opportunity was
offered when the governor, Don Alonso Fajardo de Ten&ccedil;a, was
about to send an embassy to inform the Chinese that their enemy and
ours, the Dutch, had taken up their station in the straits through
which the merchant vessels of China sail on their way to this city,
richly laden; and that the enemy intended to capture and pillage the
ships there. Our order was asked to send a religious who understood the
language, and who had worked among the Chinese in the islands; father
Fray Bartholome Martinez was chosen for the post. After some days
sailing the vessel met with a furious storm, in which it lost the
mainmast; and afterward struck upon a large rock, losing the rudder and
part of the poop. Some leaped into the water, and some made their way
to land in the boat; the rest remained on board the vessel, and father
Fray Bartholome remained with them to hear their confessions. The next
morning they all succeeded in getting to land, not far from Pangasinan.
Here father Fray Bartholome preached to the Chinese who had come to
that region to carry on business, and succeeded in converting twenty.
From Pangasinan he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88"
name="pb88">88</a>]</span>made his way with great difficulty to Nueva
Segovia, where he was directed to embark in another royal vessel, and
to carry out his embassy by way of Macan. On this voyage they also met
with dreadful storms, and he landed twice on the island of Hermosa.
This island had not yet been taken possession of for his Majesty; but
the Lord willed that the father should see it and carry to Manila a
full report as to its character, the result of which was that the
island was afterward acquired. He finally reached Macan, where he met
with so many obstacles to carrying out his mission that he was obliged
to return to Manila, and thus failed to gain that entry into China
which he had desired.</p>
<p>At the same time, another mission was planned to the kingdom of
Corea; for it seemed likely that there would be a great and noble
conversion in that kingdom, the people of which have a very good
character by nature, being very simple, and free from duplicity and
deceit. That kingdom is between Great China and Japon, so near to each
that it is separated from them only by some very narrow arms of the
sea, like large rivers. The people have the intelligence and ability of
the Chinese, without their duplicity. They are for the most part
tillers of the soil. They have some of the valor of the Japanese,
without their ferocity. It happened in 1593 that Taycosama determined
to make war against this kingdom of Corea, in order to strengthen
himself by diminishing the power of some princes of his own state, whom
he sent to make this war at their own expense. The war was most cruel
and destructive, and the kingdom of Japon was full of Corean
slaves.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e780src" href="#xd21e780" name=
"xd21e780src">13</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89"
name="pb89">89</a>]</span>Among these was one who was converted and who
came to Manila. The father of this convert (who was called Tomas)
reached the post of secretary to the king, and, taking advantage of his
wealth and high office, spared no pains in the search for his son. The
son, in spite of his love for his native country and his father, and
the hope of the wealth which he would have if he returned, was still
more devoted to his own soul; and was therefore unwilling to return to
his own country without taking with him some religious. The father
provincial, thinking this a good opportunity to begin this conversion,
assigned three religious, who set sail, on the thirteenth of June in
this year (<i>i.e.</i>, 1618) in a ship for Japon, since there was no
ship direct to Corea. At Nangasaqui the officials, detecting the
purpose of the religious, detained them and finally prevented them from
going on. Tomas was obliged to go on without them, promising to send
for them; but affairs in Japon became so disturbed that nothing more
was ever heard of him. Two of the three religious who were to go to
Corea returned to Manila. The third, father Fray Juan de Sancto
Domingo, remained in Japon and learned the language, that he might aid
the afflicted Christians there; and he was rewarded by the Lord with
the palm of martyrdom.]</p>
<p>So eager was the province to extend our holy Catholic faith
throughout all regions, to introduce it into the kingdoms of the
heathen, to enlighten their souls and show them the way to heaven, that
the Lord <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>aided them by sending in this year twenty-four new
laborers, religious who had been gathered in Espa&ntilde;a by Father
Jacintho Calvo<a class="noteref" id="xd21e797src" href="#xd21e797"
name="xd21e797src">14</a>&mdash;a religious who had been in this
province, and who on account of the severe heat in the islands, which
was dangerous to his health, sent the fathers on from Mexico, whither
he had brought them, under the leadership of father Fray Antonio
Ca&ntilde;i&ccedil;ares. They arrived here very opportunely; for by the
missions which have been mentioned several ministries had been much
interfered with, and were now filled up from this new company. Even
some new convents were established; for instance that of San Telmo at
Cavite. This town is the port where all those go aboard who sail from
these islands to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a or to Yndia or to other
regions&mdash;except in the case of small vessels, which are able to
sail from the city. In Cavite there is accordingly a large town of
Spaniards, Indians, Chinese, and Japanese. At that time they were in
greater need of Christian teaching because they had only one convent,
that of the seraphic father St. Francis; and, besides, our order needed
to have a convent there in which the religious might remain while
waiting to go aboard the vessels. On this account this convent of San
Telmo was established there at that time, and did great good to those
who lived in the town. The Confraternity of our Lady of the Rosary was
immediately carried thither; and this holy devotion was greatly
revived, and other very good effects were wrought. Thus for the
Virgin&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>sake the people of the town have come to have a
great regard for her chaplains; and a fine church, with rich altar
decorations and ornaments, and a convent sufficient for the religious
who are obliged to be at Cavite, have been built there. This is
supported very well by alms, without any other income; and the
religious with their sermons and good example have wrought much good,
not only among the Spaniards, but also among the natives. There has
been a great reformation of morals among both, as is always effected by
the devotion to the Virgin of the Rosary, wherever care is taken to
give due heed to preaching it, and to using it as a benefit come from
heaven, by the hands of the Virgin, to correct the sins and reform the
excesses of the world.</p>
<p>During this year a beginning was also made in an undertaking which
had been much desired by good and spiritual religious, as being worthy
of and proper to that charity with which the religious of this province
usually took up enterprises involving great labor, that they might in
return offer souls to the Lord and bring heathen into the church. There
are near the province of Nueva Segovia certain islands, called
Babuianes, following each other in a line toward the northeast until
they approach near those which are called Lequios, which are near
Japon.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e804src" href="#xd21e804" name=
"xd21e804src">15</a> These latter are innumerable, and some of them are
very large and very fertile. Their inhabitants are of excellent natural
dispositions, so that, being heathen, they cause wonder in all of those
who go <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>there. They are extremely kind, loving, docile,
and free from self-interest&mdash;excellent foundations for their
becoming noble Christians if the happy day of the faith shall dawn upon
them. The islands near Nueva Segovia are not fertile, being plagued
with fierce winds, which, sweeping over them without any defense, do
them great damage. The inhabitants, however, are very ingenuous and
simple. When they sometimes came to Nueva Segovia to do their poor
little trading, the hearts of the religious were grieved when they saw
those people of a natural disposition so excellent, so humble and
peaceable; while their souls were left totally without assistance
because they were poor and few, and widely scattered over many islands
in the midst of the sea, without hope that any other preachers would
undertake their conversion if our religious neglected them. They had a
Spanish encomendero, who went duly every year to demand his tribute
from them; but he paid no attention to providing them with Christian
teaching, civilization, or justice. He saw them only when he collected
his tribute, without caring about them all the rest of the year, and
without trying to do them any good, as he was bound to do. The
religious had many times conferred about the conversion of these poor
people, but their purposes had never taken effect until this year, when
the religious came from Espa&ntilde;a; and then preachers were sent to
them. That it might be possible to reach them, the inhabitants of many
islands were gathered on one, where they could more conveniently be
taught; they were baptized, and became very good Christians. In this
way the great labor was somewhat diminished, and the religious were
enabled to bear the almost total absence of comfort <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>among
them; for they were imprisoned on a small island from which during many
months of the year it was impossible to have any communication with
other people. The land was so scanty and in every way so poor that it
did not produce even enough rice for the food of the inhabitants; but
yielded only borona and other grains of less excellence than rice, or
even something inferior to this. The people generally sustained
themselves on roots, potatoes, and such things. If this fails, as often
happens, it is necessary for the religious to support them by giving
them the little they themselves have, and asking alms from the other
convents of Nueva Segovia. All this was evident before the religious
went to convert them, as was also the inconvenience which results if
the religious are ill&mdash;as they must inevitably be much of the
time&mdash;for there is no physician there, nor are there any
medicines; and for nearly half the year it is not possible for a
religious to go thence to be cared for where he can have them, or even
to send a letter. During this period this sea is not navigable, for it
is very stormy; and the boats which they have there, being the boats of
poor persons, are small. Yet all this, and the fact that those natives
have a different language from all the rest, and many other
inconveniences which they suffered there, the religious bore with
pleasure, being good and devout Christians. They are in two little
villages, with a church and a convent in each, sufficient for its
needs. Though the Indians provided the labor, all the rest was a gift
which the religious had made and are making to them. Since they had
religious, there have been several attacks of smallpox in various
years, which is almost like a plague among the Indians&mdash;attacking
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>practically all of them, and being very fatal. On
these occasions great numbers of baptized children have gone to heaven;
and there have been many cases of the special providence with which the
Lord takes hence those who are predestinated. The love and devotion
with which the ministers strive for their salvation is so great that he
only who has seen it can believe it. On the one hand the people were
good Christians, humble and devout, and on the other hand so poor and
needy that it seemed as if the people and their country had been
rejected by all lands and men. Hence the religious, taking them in
charge, pitied their miseries and strove to provide relief for them in
both their temporal and their more important spiritual necessities.
Thus, in times of need, the religious have come to Nueva Segovia to ask
alms from house to house, sometimes undergoing manifest danger of
drowning to help these Indians. As for their souls, the care which they
take of them may be inferred from the following case. The principal
minister, father Fray Jacintho de San Geronimo, learned that a poor
woman was in the fields about to give birth to a child. She had not
come to the village, as they commonly do, perhaps because she could
not. The religious pitied her, and went to find her and bring her to
the town, so that in her need she might find someone to help her when
she should be delivered. With all this solicitude it took him some days
to find her, so far away from all companionship did she live. When she
had been brought to the village she was provided for by the religious,
and brought forth two children. They were baptized by the religious,
and both died within a short time, going to enjoy God forever because
of the devoted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>care given to them by their spiritual father while
their natural parents left them on the road to perdition; for without
doubt they would have been lost, if the religious had not had the
mother brought to the village for her delivery.</p>

Christianity held the government of Nagasaki. With great acuteness the
persecutors set about capturing the religious who were concealed in the
city. On the thirteenth of December, 1618, they found two convents and
captured four religious, two of our order, Fray Angel Ferrer and Fray
Juan de Sancto Domingo, with some Japanese. At the same time they
captured Father Carlos Espinola and Brother Ambrosio Hernandez of the
Society of Jesus, with their Portuguese landlord. The fathers, on being
interrogated, confessed who they were. The two Japanese youths, the
servants of the religious, whom the judges desired to set free,
insisted that they were Christians, and declared that they were not
ignorant of the profession of the religious, so that the judges were
obliged to imprison them. The Japanese Christians crowded in and
shouted, and some of them made a bold confession of faith. The
persecution of the Christians throughout the kingdom of Japon increased
greatly in severity, but the Christians protected the fathers and did
not give them up. Even in the midst of the persecution many were
converted and baptized, and other religious came into the kingdom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>to carry on the work. The fathers in prison were
treated with great severity. Father Fray Juan de Sancto Domingo fell
ill in prison, and finally died there. His imprisoned brethren desired
to keep his body as that of a saint; but, being unable to do so, cut
off a foot and a hand, keeping them for their comfort. The Japanese
took the body, intending to burn it and to scatter the ashes in the
sea; but though they built a great funeral pyre they were unable to
burn it, and finally threw it into the ocean, weighted with chains. The
holy martyr was a native of Castilla la Vieja, of the region of Campos
near Sanabria, and assumed the habit in the convent of San Estevan at
Salamanca. He came to this holy province in the year 1601. He was
assigned to the ministry of Bataan, where he learned the language
<span class="corr" id="xd21e824" title=
"Source: guickly">quickly</span>, as he did also the language of
Pampanga. Hence he was sent to Pangasinan, where he learned a third
Indian language. When he was afterward sent to preach the holy gospel
in the kingdom of Corea, he remained in Japon to assist the afflicted
Christians there, being persuaded to do so by the holy Fray Francisco
de Morales. He was engaged in the occupation of learning the Japanese
language when he was captured by the persecutors.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The intermediate chapter, and the death of father Fray
Juan de Leyva</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the year of our Lord 1619 the intermediate chapter
in the term of father Fray Melchior de Man&ccedil;ano was held, on the
twentieth of April, in the convent of our father St. Dominic at Nueva
Segovia. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>In it many important ordinances were passed, which
were of assistance in supporting the observance of the rules and in
making illustrious our order. This was the first provincial chapter
held in that province [<i>i.e.</i>, of Nueva Segovia], and it was
accordingly conducted with much dignity and was attended by many of the
religious of this province. Their number was great, but greater was the
divine Providence and the paternal affection with which the Lord
sustained them, showing forth His greatness so plainly that it was
obvious to all that He it was who provided the religious with their
daily food. [During the session of the chapter, there was a wonderful
catch of excellent fish called <i lang="es">taraquitos</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e842src" href="#xd21e842" name="xd21e842src">16</a>
On this occasion they were so large that they weighed ninety libras,
and so abundant that they sufficed not only for the whole chapter, but
for all the Spaniards. All that beheld this were amazed, because the
fish of this kind which had hitherto been caught there were but few and
small, never weighing more than four libras. No fish so large, and no
such numbers of these fish, had been seen before, or were seen
afterwards. The very Chinese fishermen who were heathen were the most
amazed; for being desirous of continuing the fishery for gain after the
close of the chapter, they did not catch a single fish of this
kind.]</p>
<p>In this provincial chapter was received and incorporated into the
province the college of Sancto Thomas at Manila, which had been in
process of erection for some years, and was now ready to be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>occupied. The first man to plan this great work
was the archbishop of Manila, Don Fray Miguel de Benavides. Being a
learned and a holy man, he was grieved that there was in his province
no fixed and regular school of learning&mdash;as there was not at that
time, the fathers contenting themselves with carrying on instruction
when there was need of it. This was only when among the religious who
came from Espa&ntilde;a there were some who had not finished their
studies; and in such cases they were given to masters to teach them.
The places of masters were filled with as much system as in the schools
in Espa&ntilde;a, by the fathers Fray Juan Cobo, Fray Juan de San Pedro
Martyr, Fray Francisco de Morales, and others. When the religious had
completed their courses, the schools were brought to an end; and the
masters with their pupils, who were now sufficiently instructed, went
to preach the gospel to these peoples. This was the end for which
schools were established, and for which both pupils and teachers had
come from Espa&ntilde;a, many of them leaving behind them the chairs
from which they lectured&mdash;coming here not to lecture, but to
convert souls. All this did not satisfy the great mind and the
charitable heart of the archbishop. He declared that lecturing and
teaching were matters of great importance in the Order of St. Dominic,
and were ordained to a lofty end; and that they had as their purpose
not only ministering and preaching the gospel, but also the creation of
ministers and preachers, which is a superior and creative work, as the
degree of the bishops is superior to that of the priests. Therefore,
though the priests have the lofty duty of consecrating and offering the
most sacred body of Christ, the bishops are those who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>make
these priests. Likewise the lecturers and masters of theology in this
land surpass the ministers and preachers of the gospel, since with
their teaching they make them fit for this very office. On this account
lecturers might well come from Espa&ntilde;a to lecture in this
country, to their own great advantage; since in Espa&ntilde;a they make
preachers for that kingdom, where there is not so great a need of
persons to preach, and where the effect of their sermons is not so
great or so certain as here. Further&mdash;and this he repeated many
times&mdash;our constitutions, made after consideration and reflection
upon this matter, require that there should be no convent of ours in
which there is not a doctor or master who is actually engaged in
teaching; they require that in the provinces there shall be organized,
settled, and permanent schools of higher learning. Hence, as our
province lays so great stress upon the observance of our sacred
constitutions, it ought not to regard itself as released from the
obligation to carry out this one. This requirement, as is evident from
the constitutions themselves, is one of the most important and one for
which a very special observance and regard is commanded. With this
argument he convinced the minds of the religious, and they began to try
to establish the schools. The death of the archbishop soon occurred,
after he had held his office for only two years. He did what he could
by leaving to this work his library and all that he had, the whole of
which, as befitted one vowed to poverty, came to only two thousand
pesos. However, it did much toward making a beginning to this holy and
necessary work. This institution was so beneficial to his archbishopric
that it may be said that since it was established there are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>competitors for benefices, who have studied so
that they may be able to hold them; while previously there were no such
persons, and even no persons who desired to study&mdash;because, since
no one had studied, it was necessary to appoint men to benefices, even
if they had not learning. On this account they did not understand the
obligation which rested upon them if they received the benefices, and
were unwilling to spend time or labor upon study when they could obtain
benefices without. Since the establishment of this college there are
competitors for benefices who have studied; and hence those who come
into competition with them are obliged to study&mdash;being certain
that a benefice will not be taken away from a good student to give it
to one who has no knowledge. After this good beginning made by the
archbishop, the province entrusted to the holy Fray Bernardo de Sancta
Catalina the care of this work. Since he was beloved and esteemed by
all, there were many to aid him with great benefactions. Everything
that was given was bestowed without any conditions, though the college
keeps these benefactions in memory&mdash;feeling obliged to commend the
benefactors to God all the more carefully, on account of the confidence
in the religious which they showed. This was so great that they asked
for no more security than their own knowledge that the religious would
do this for them, which was without doubt a better security than any
other that they could ask in return for their benefactions. The
building was begun and the college was founded during the term of the
father provincial Fray Baltasar Fort. The title of founder was given to
him who was the cause of the foundation and who gave the first gift for
that purpose. This was, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>has been said, the archbishop Don
Fray Miguel de Venavides, as appears from the document of foundation
which is in the same college. Some years later the bishop of Nueva
Segovia, Don Fray Diego de Soria, being near to death, left to the
college his library, and three thousand eight hundred pesos which he
possessed. With this sum the building was continued, and in this year
[<i>i.e.</i>, 1619] on the day of the Assumption of our Lady, twelve
lay collegians entered on residence. Father Fray Balthasar Fort was
appointed as rector, with two lecturers in theology, one in arts, and
one in grammar; and the college was opened with great formality, and
with the same care and attention as in the best institutions in
Espa&ntilde;a. The lecturers and the rector had all been trained in
distinguished schools belonging to our religious order; and they
carried on their lectures, conferences, and other academic exercises in
the same manner in which they had followed the courses in
Espa&ntilde;a. The same system has been persevered in and carried
further. Afterward, to encourage the students, the sanction of his
Majesty and a brief from the supreme pontiff were obtained, granting
this college authority to give all the degrees which are given in other
universities, with all the privileges which the graduates of those
universities have throughout the Indias. The students have performed
their exercises for graduation as brilliantly as they could be
performed in the best conducted universities in Espa&ntilde;a; and the
examination is regarded as even more rigorous, in the judgment of many
persons of authority who have seen both of them. The income of the
college has increased steadily with the course of time, in proportion
to the number of collegians, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>of whom there are now usually
about thirty; and in buildings, income, and instruction, the college
may compete with the finest in Espa&ntilde;a.</p>
<p>[In the month of October in the same year, father Fray Juan de Leyva
died in the province of Nueva Segovia. Father Fray Juan was a native of
La Rioja, and was born in a village named Gra&ntilde;on. He lost his
mother when he was a very young child, but had been so carefully
trained in the devotion of our Lady, that he immediately chose her as
his mother. He left his own country while very young, and went to
Madrid, the country of all, being commended to an honorable person who
took him thence to Valencia del Cid. Here by the death of his
benefactor or from some other cause he was left alone, a child of
twelve in a strange country. He determined to make his way back to
Madrid on foot. He reached the convent of our Lady at Atocha, where he
was overcome with fatigue. In response to his prayers, our Lady opened
the way to him to enter the convent of our Lady at Atocha, by the
patronage of a noble person. He was an excellent student, and as such
was sent to our college of Sancto Thomas at Alcala. Here in the year
1605 he heard the voice that called him to the mission of the
Philippinas, and he was most humble and obedient. After he had begun to
study the language of the Chinese in the mission of Binondoc, he was
called upon to go to Nueva Segovia because of the need of religious
there; and he uncomplainingly obeyed, without giving a thought to the
great amount of labor which he had given to learning the new language
which he now laid aside. He succeeded well with the language of Nueva
Segovia, although on account of his age it was difficult for him to
learn it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>He was most devoted to the care of the altars,
the adornment of the church, and the holy sacraments. When he gave
extreme unction, he was accustomed to wash with his own hands the feet
of the Indian who was to receive the sacrament. He never entrusted the
lamp of the most holy sacrament to boys, but himself provided it with
oil, raised the wick, and cleaned the vessel. He was most constant in
prayer, adding an hour to the two hours universally observed in the
province; and he usually made this hour so long that it lasted from one
to five, at which time he went to complines. He was so sparing in
eating that the little which he ate at a meal often lasted him for
twenty-four hours, so that in time his stomach came to be so reduced in
size that any little thing overloaded it. He was prior of the convent
of Manila, and definitor in a provincial chapter. Being elected as
procurator, he was unable to fulfil his office, inasmuch as the vessel
in which he was to go did not sail. He therefore returned to his
Indians in Nueva Segovia. Here by his hand the Lord wrought miraculous
works, granting children to childless parents and healing the sick. He
died a holy death, and was honorably mentioned in the provincial
chapter that followed.]</p>
<p>Toward the end of November in this year, on St. Andrew&rsquo;s day,
a terrible earthquake occurred in these islands. It extended from
Manila to the extreme limits of the province of Nueva Segovia, a
distance of two hundred leguas. This earthquake, which was such as had
never been seen before, did great damage throughout all of this region
and made a great impression. In the province of Ylocos palm-trees were
buried, leaving only their tops above the ground. Some mountains struck
against others, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span>the great force of the earthquake,
overthrowing many buildings and killing people. Its greatest violence
was in Nueva Segovia, where the mountains opened and new fountains of
water were uncovered. The earth vomited out great masses of sand, and
trembled so that people could not stand on their feet, but sat on the
ground; and were as seasick on land as if they had been in a ship at
sea in a storm. In the high lands of the Indians named
Mandayas<a class="noteref" id="xd21e881src" href="#xd21e881" name=
"xd21e881src">17</a> a mountain fell and, catching a village below it,
overwhelmed it and killed the inhabitants. One large tract of land near
the river which previously had contained little mountains, as it were,
most of it being at a considerable elevation, sank downward, and is now
almost level with the margin of the water. The movement in the bed of
the river was so great that it raised waves like those at sea, or such
as are aroused by the blasts of a furious wind. The stone buildings
suffered the greatest damage. Our church and convent in the city were
totally overthrown, the very foundations giving way in places, because
of the sinking of the earth. It was no small comfort to be able to find
the most holy sacrament in this most pitiful ruin, with the consecrated
loaves unbroken and unharmed. There were nine religious at that time in
the convent, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>three of whom were outside of the
house&mdash;the rest escaping, not without a special providence of God.
Father Fray Ambrosio de la Madre de Dios was protected in the arch of a
window, everything on all sides of him having fallen. There were
persons who declared that they had seen above the walls of the
enclosure a matron in the dress and mantle which our Lady is accustomed
to wear. It was no new thing for the sovereign princess to come to the
protection of her friars in their great distress; but because of the
great disturbance, and the carelessness ordinarily shown about such
things in religious orders, the verification of these facts was
neglected. Only one religious, named Fray Juan de San
Loren&ccedil;o,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e895src" href="#xd21e895"
name="xd21e895src">18</a> who was sick in bed, had his arm broken by a
beam which fell upon it; and only one Indian boy who was waiting upon
him was killed. This religious lived for some years, and offered a
noble example of patience in enduring the cruel miseries and the
terrible pains occasioned by the blow, of which he finally died.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[In the hospice belonging to the province in the City
of Mexico, there died at this time father Fray Athanasio de Moya, a
near relative of the holy archbishop of Valencia, Don Fray Thomas de
Villanueva. He assumed the habit in the royal convent of Sancta Cruz at
Segovia, where he showed great courage and devotion in the great plague
of 1599. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>In 1601 he came to this province, and was
assigned to the ministry of Bataan. From here he was sent back to care
for the hospice of San Jacintho at Mexico, where he constantly followed
the rigorous rules of the province of the Philippinas.</p>
<p>In the next vessels which left for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a the superior
of this province sent father Fray Juan Naya to take the place of the
father who had just died. The Lord, who had carried father Fray Juan
throughout his life through great sufferings, ordained that he should
not fight the last fight in the delightful clime of Mexico; and hence
was pleased to take him to himself before the voyage to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a was concluded. He was a native of Aragon, and assumed the
habit of the order in our convent of San Pedro Martyr at Calatayud. His
proficiency and scholarship was such, and such was his virtue, that he
was appointed master of novices while still very young. The Lord
wrought miracles through him. He cast out a demon from a sick woman in
Espa&ntilde;a; was miraculously protected from death on the island of
Guadalupe; and was delivered from an illness which afflicted him in the
Philippinas, by [making a vow to our Lady, as follows:] &ldquo;I, Fray
Juan Naya, being afflicted by this severe infirmity, and seeing that I
am very much hindered from carrying on the ministry for which I came
from Espa&ntilde;a, vow and promise, as humbly and devoutly as I may,
to the most blessed Virgin Mary, my Lady, that I will minister to the
Indians in this ministry, remaining and assisting in it at the command
of my superior, in reverence and honor for this most sacred Virgin, my
Lady, for seven continuous years from the day of her Visitation, the
second of July, 1605, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>if she will deign to obtain for me
from her most holy Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, comfortable and
sufficient health for me to be able to accomplish that which is
necessary in this ministry; and I vow that, if I shall gain this
health, I will exercise the ministry.&rdquo; This humble supplication
was heard at that tribunal of mercy, and our Lady of Compassion granted
him his health so completely that at the end of the month he was well
and strong enough to learn the language, and in three months was fit to
render service and labor in it. As a memorial of this marvelous
goodness, he kept this vow written in his breviary, and, as often as he
read it there, he used always to give devout thanks to her who had
gained that health for him; and with great devotion he fulfilled his
vow, to the great gain of the Indians in this province. At the end of
the seven years he was afflicted with a flux of the bowels, with
abundance of blood; and on the same day of the Visitation he made
another vow to serve four years more in the ministry in the honor of
this Lady. He received complete health, so that he was able to labor in
it for that time and much longer, as one of the best of the ministers
of religion, giving a great example of holiness and virtue wherever he
was. When he was living in the district of Ytabes, in a village of that
province named Tuao, he was once burying a dead man in the cemetery
when a venomous snake came out from the grass and, amid the noise and
alarm of the people, entered between his leg and his
breeches&mdash;which was an easy thing for the snake to do, since these
garments are worn loose in this province and resemble <i lang=
"es">polainas</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e914src" href="#xd21e914"
name="xd21e914src">19</a> Although the Indians, who knew how
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>poisonous the snake was, cried out and gave him
over for dead, father Fray Juan continued with the act which he was
performing, because of his duty as a religious, until he had finished
burying the Indian; and then, putting his hand in his breeches, he
caught the snake by the neck, and drew it out and threw it away,
without receiving any harm from it. [When father Fray Juan was vicar of
Yrraya, and was living in a village called Abuatan, a fire broke out.
Father Fray Juan threw himself on his knees and prayed that the fire
should turn away from the village, as it did&mdash;making its way
straight toward the tambobos, or granaries where the Indians kept their
food, the loss of which would have been a greater damage than the
burning of the village. In response to the prayers of father Fray Juan,
the wind fell and the fire ceased. On one occasion his guardian angel
came to accompany him in his prayers. When he was assigned to the
vicariate of San Jacintho at Mexico, he embarked in the flagship sent
back that year, in which more than sixty persons died because of the
hardships and length of the voyage. Father Fray Juan was attacked by
some malignant fevers, and when he asked for extreme unction, on the
day of St. John the Evangelist, the sailors were so much alarmed at the
fear of losing his prayers that they declared that if he died they
would not continue their voyage, but would go back to the island of the
Ladrones, that they might not perish in the dreadful storms to which
they would be exposed if they had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109"
href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>not the aid and comfort of
father Fray Juan. At the demand of the sailors, the general asked
father Fray Juan if they should continue their voyage. The sick man was
grieved at being asked that which was reserved for God alone; but he
was persuaded to tell what God had given him to know, and made a sign
for them to go on. His poor possessions were shared among those of the
ship as precious relics; and on the octave of St. John, on the third of
January, 1620, a fair wind began to blow. The sailors cried out
joyfully: &ldquo;Father Fray Juan has seen God, and has sent us fair
weather.&rdquo; On the seventh of the same month, they began to descry
signs of land coming from the coast of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, whereupon
they regarded as fulfilled that which the holy religious had promised
them.</p>
<p>Father Fray Gaspar Zarfate was a native of the City of Mexico, and
assumed the habit and professed in the convent of that city. He was a
teacher of the arts in the convent at Puebla de los Angeles, whence he
volunteered to come to this province. He reached the islands in 1595,
and was one of the first founders of Christianity in the province of
Nueva Segovia. Here he labored much, with great results. He devoted
himself to the study of the language of the Indians in that region, and
his attainments in it were very great. He was the first to make a
grammar of this language, and he knew a very large number of words in
it. Thus he opened the way for the other religious, that they might as
a result of his labors more easily learn this language, and preach the
holy gospel in it. He was most penitent and devoted to prayer; and so
completely master of his passions that, though by nature he was very
choleric, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>seemed excessively phlegmatic. At one time when
he was vicar of Camalaniugan an Indian saw our father St. Dominic
praying in his company, and surrounded by light from heaven. In the
village of Nasiping it was said that father Fray Gaspar had raised a
child from the dead. The verification of this matter was neglected, but
father Fray Gaspar&rsquo;s reputation for sanctity was such that no one
regarded the statement as incredible. He was made preacher-general of
the province, in which there was only one such preacher. He was
definitor, vicar-provincial, and twice prior of the convent of Manila,
in which city he had the name of &ldquo;the holy prior.&rdquo; He
suffered greatly from a urinary disease, from which he finally died. He
received honorable mention on the records of the provincial chapter
during this same year.]</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter XVII</h3>
<h3 class="main">The election as provincial of father Fray Miguel Ruiz,
and events in the province at this time</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the first of May, 1621, father Fray Miguel Ruiz was
elected as provincial, to the great satisfaction of the province. He
was a son of the royal convent of Sancta Cruz at Segovia; and at the
time of his election was prior of the convent of Manila, which position
he had held twice. He exhibited in it and in other important dignities
the excellent qualities which are desired in a good superior&mdash;much
virtue and learning, great prudence, and natural gravity and kindness,
which, while rendering him much beloved, did not allow others to lose
respect for him. In this chapter many ordinances were <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>enacted which were helpful for the quiet and
calm of the religious. During this year two religious went from Nueva
Segovia to Japon, and, after having suffered much in that kingdom, they
had the fortunate end of glorious martyrdom&mdash;being burnt alive by
a slow fire, as will be seen later. A fortunate provincialate was
promised because it had begun so joyfully; for at that time the
verification of a most famous miracle wrought by our Lady of the Rosary
was being concluded. She went, in her holy image which she had in the
convent of Manila, to give aid. (as she did most marvelously) to a
votary of hers by the name of Francisco Lopez, who called upon her in
the extreme necessity of his soul. The narrative, with the most
marvelous circumstances which accompanied her act, has already been
given in the part of this history which treats of the foundation of
this convent&mdash;where something has also been narrated with regard
to the great deeds of this most holy image, and some account has been
given of the innumerable miracles which it has wrought and still works.
Among them this, which was the most famous, has been
described.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e939src" href="#xd21e939" name=
"xd21e939src">20</a> On account of it, this most holy image was brought
out during the procession which was made to the cathedral on the first
Sunday of the chapter-meeting, and with its beauty and the special joy
of that day, the city was filled with delight and devotion. The miracle
was made the subject of sermons, and was painted upon a canvas, and
thus the devotion of all to this sovereign lady was greatly increased;
and she, as if by grace omnipotent, from that day forward conferred
more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>and greater favors on her votaries. She so
greatly multiplied the working of manifest miracles that, although many
of them have been recounted in the place referred to, there were
incomparably more which were omitted on account of their number; and
she has never ceased and will never cease to work the like marvels,
until the devotion of this city for her shall cease. This provincialate
was also very happy in the great number of holy martyrs which the
province had during it. A detailed account of them will be given, so
far as we have been able to learn the facts, though many great and
edifying matters must remain in silence because the disturbances of the
persecution gave no opportunity for verifying them. Yet that which is
certain is so much that it alone would be sufficient to give glory to
an entire religious order; and how much more to a small
province&mdash;so small that there were many convents in Espa&ntilde;a
which alone contained more religious than this entire province. Under
all these circumstances, for the Lord to give so many and so great
saints to it is a special mercy; and however much we may strive to
praise and give thanks for it, our praise and gratitude will never
reach the obligation, which is far and beyond measure above our feeble
strength.</p>
<p>All these new causes of joy were necessary to temper the sorrow
caused among the religious of this province by the rising of a large
number of Indians, which happened on the sixth of November in this year
in the most distant parts of the province of Nueva Segovia, in the
region known as Yrraya. On the Friday before, a very large and
beautiful cross had been set up in the court or cemetery of the church
in the largest village there, which was called Abuatan. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>At
this time the Indians gave every evidence of joy and pleasure and even
of devotion to the Lord who redeemed us on the cross; but on the
following Sunday, instigated by the devil, they burnt their churches
and villages, and avowed themselves enemies of the Spaniards, and even
of God, whom they left that they might return to their ancient sites to
serve the devil in exchange for the enjoyments of the liberties and
vices of their heathen state. Practically all those in this village,
and many of those in another near it called Pilitan, belonged to a
tribe called Gadanes.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e951src" href=
"#xd21e951" name="xd21e951src">21</a> This tribe was always regarded as
one on a lower plane of civilization than the others, and more devoted
to freedom, and enemies to subjection; for they were a race bred in the
most distant mountains and the wildernesses of that province, and they
had less communication and commerce than did the other tribes&mdash;not
only with the Spaniards, but even with the rest of the Indians. It was
these Gadanes, then, who became restless, and disquieted the other
inhabitants of that region, though these others had always been very
faithful to God and the Spaniards. They had even sustained many bloody
wars with the neighbors by whom they were surrounded that they might
not be lacking in the friendship <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114"
href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>which they had with the
Spaniards, or in the subjection which they had promised them. But now
these revolted and joined the insurgents, partly as the result of force
applied by the Gadanes&mdash;for the latter greatly excelled them in
numbers, and caught them unprepared for defense&mdash;and partly also
carried away by their own natural desire for liberty, to which they
were invited by the safety of the mountains to which they proposed to
go. The mountains, being very rough, offered opportunities for easy
defense; and, being very fertile, promised them an abundant living. The
Gadanes had planned this revolt far ahead, and had appointed a day for
it to occur some time later. Their purpose was to try to get back first
certain chiefs who were held as hostages in the city of the Spaniards;
and they had already sent there one of their chiefs, named Saquin, who
had the influence of a father over the rest, that he might bring away
these chiefs, with great dissimulation and pretended arguments of
necessity. It happened that the father vicar of Abuatan had grown weary
of his work, and wished to resign his office. He had gone down at that
time to the city to ask the father provincial, who happened to be there
then, to give this office to someone else and to permit him to take
some rest by being under his directions. The Gadanes, accused by their
own bad consciences, supposed that he had detected their purpose of
rising, and had gone down to ask for soldiers to prevent it. In fear of
interference, they hastened on their treacherous act; and, without
waiting for the appointed period, or for the return of him who had gone
down for the hostages (their relatives), they decided to rise at once.
Without further deliberation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href=
"#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>or delay, they began active
operations. Father Fray Alonso Hernandez, who was at Abuatan, heard the
tumult; and being above measure sad at what was happening, he tried his
best to quiet them. He told them how foolish their proceedings were,
and how they were deceived by the devil, not only as to the good of
their souls, but also as to the many temporal advantages, which they
possessed in their trade, with the Spaniards as well as with the rest
of the Indians&mdash;in which they gained so much that they were the
richest and most prosperous Indians in all that region. All this, he
said, and their own quiet, peace, and comfort would be destroyed by
their rising; while if they would keep quiet they would preserve it
all, for he assured them that no harm would happen to them for what
they intended to do. But the chiefs who led the insurgents said to him
that he should not waste his time by talking about this; and that it
was now too late, since they were determined to carry on what they had
begun. &ldquo;What is it that moves you,&rdquo; said the religious,
&ldquo;to so imprudent an act? If the religious have done you any
wrong, you have me here in your power; revenge it upon me, take my life
in pay for it, and do not cast away your souls.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is not
because of any wrong from the religious, or resentment toward
them,&rdquo; said the Indians, &ldquo;but because we are weary of the
oppressive acts of the Spaniards. Depart hence in peace; for though it
is true that our rising is not against the religious, we cannot promise
that some drunken Indian may not try to take off your head.&rdquo; The
religious perceived the obstinacy of the Gadanes, and the fact that
arguments would be useless in this matter, and went away to watch over
the village of Pilitan, which was under <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>his care. He found it
quiet, but that peace continued for a very short time; for
presently&mdash;this was early Sunday morning&mdash;he heard a very
great noise and a loud Indian war-cry. They came in a crowd, after
their ancient custom, naked, and thickly anointed with oil, and with
weapons in their hands. It was the insurgents from Abuatan, coming to
force the Indians of Pilitan to join the uprising, in order that they
might have more strength to resist the Spaniards when the latter should
make war upon them to bring them to subjection. One of the chiefs who
were leading the insurgents, named Don Phelippe Cutapay, a young man of
about twenty-three, came forward. He had been brought up from infancy
in the church with the religious, and when he was a mere child had
aided in mass as sacristan, and afterward as cantor; and at this time
he was governor of Abuatan. He went direct to the church to speak to
the religious, intending to inform him as to what they were about to
do, and to advise him to go down the river, for fear that someone might
get beyond control and harm him. While he was talking with the
religious in the cloister, his elder brother, named Don Gabriel Dayag,
who was acting as guide to the others, came in. Being somewhat nervous
and excited, he approached the religious with little courtesy; Cutapay
rebuked him for the way in which he was acting, saying to him that he
should remember that he was before the father, to whom he owed more
respect. The elder brother answered: &ldquo;Cutapay, if our minds are
divided we shall do nothing;&rdquo; however, he grew calm and behaved
respectfully in the presence of the religious. The shouting increased,
and there were now in the courtyard of the church about <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>eight hundred Indians armed and prepared for
battle. The religious roused his courage, and, laying aside all fear,
went out to them; and standing in the midst of this multitude, as a
sheep among wolves, he caused them to sit down, and addressed them for
more than an hour. He urged upon them what would be for their good, and
strove to persuade them to see the great error into which they were
falling. Among other things in the utterances which the Lord is
accustomed to impart under such circumstances, he said: &ldquo;My sons,
among whom I have so long been, and to whom I have so many years
preached the true doctrine, which you ought to follow, and have taught
you that which you ought to observe for the good of your souls, I am
greatly grieved to see the mistaken path which you take, casting
yourselves over precipices where destruction is certain, and from which
your rescue is difficult. If your wish to run away is on account of the
bad treatment which you have received from us religious&mdash;and from
me in particular, as being less prudent than others&mdash;here you have
me alone and defenseless. Slay me then, slay me, and do not cast away
your souls. Let me pay with my life the evil which you are about to do;
and do not lose your faith and your hope of salvation, nor pay in hell
for the sin of this uprising, and for the many sins which you will add
to it in your revolt.&rdquo; Some of them made the same answer as
before; that they had not done this because of ill-will toward the
religious; but on the contrary, they felt for them affection and love,
and therefore did not intend to do them any harm. This they said was
plain because, although they had him alone in the midst of them, no one
was rude to him, but even in the midst of the tumult <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>showed him respect. &ldquo;The reason of our
uprising,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;is that we are weary of the
oppressions of the Spaniards; and if you or any other religious desire
to come to our villages, any one of you may come whenever he pleases,
providing he does not bring a Spaniard.&rdquo; The religious responded
by offering that the Spaniards would do them no harm, especially for
what they had already done, promising himself to remain among them as
security, so that they might take away his life if the least harm
should come to them from that cause. But they were very far indeed from
accepting this good advice; and some of them went away and set fire to
some houses, upon which a great outcry arose in the village. Cutapay
stood up and greatly blamed what had been done, saying that it was very
ill considered and a daring outrage to set fire. &ldquo;I call your
attention,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to the fact that the father is in the
village; and so long as he is here nothing should be done to grieve
him;&rdquo; and he commanded people to go and put out the fire and to
calm the village. The religious began to preach to them again; but,
though there were so many people before him, he was preaching in the
desert, and hence could accomplish nothing with them. They asked the
father to depart, and to take with him the silver and ornaments of the
sacristy of this church and of that of Abuatan. This was no small
generosity from an excited body of insurgents. They provided him with
boats, and men to row them, and the friars went down the river to the
friendly villages. The insurgents immediately began to commit a
thousand extravagances. They set fire to the houses, they drank, and
they annoyed the people in the village. If any were unwilling to join
them, they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>threatened them with death by holding lances to
their breasts. The result was that many joined them, being forced by
the fear of instant death, and waiting for a better time when they
could again have religious. A few of them succeeded in hiding, and
going down the river after the fathers, some leaving their sons and
others their fathers. There was one chief who, despising his wealth and
his gold, left it all and came with the religious, taking with him only
his wife. His name was Don Bernabe Lumaban. Do&ntilde;a Agustina Pamma,
who was a member of one of the most noble families of the region and
the wife of one of the chiefs, hid herself in a marsh&mdash;standing in
it up to her neck that she might be left behind, and might go to a
Christian village. However, she was discovered, and was taken along by
the insurgents. But the Lord did not fail to reward her pious desires,
for within a few years she accomplished them, and lived for a long
time, as she desired, in the church. The insurgents did not cease until
they had roused all the villages in their vicinity. As men abandoned of
God and directed by the devil, they were guilty of horrible sacrileges.
In the village of Abuatan they sacked the church and the sacristy, and
made a jest and derision of the things which they found there. They
treated irreverently that which they had a little before reverenced:
the women put on the frontals as petticoats [<i>sayas</i>], and of the
corporals and the palls of the chalices they made head-kerchiefs. They
dressed themselves in the habits of the religious, and even went so far
as to lose their respect for the image of the Virgin. The feet and
hands of this image were of ivory, and it was one of the most beautiful
in all that province and in all the islands. There <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>was
one man who dared to give it a slash across the nose, saying,
&ldquo;Let us see if she will bleed.&rdquo; They also committed other
sacrileges, and even greater ones, as a barbarous tribe of apostates.
Afterward an Indian, finding an opportunity to flee from them to a
Catholic region, did so; and he went not alone, for he carried with him
the holy image of the Virgin of the Rosary which had been slashed
across the face. Although it was received with great rejoicings by the
Christians, they could but shed many tears to see it so outraged. All
this grieved the hearts of the religious who had trained and taught
them, and who now saw them lost irremediably and without reason; for
although they said that they could not endure the oppressions of the
Spaniards, these were not so great but that the profit which the
Indians gained by their commerce with them was very much greater. The
man who at that time used to collect the tributes was so kind a man and
so good a Christian that, confident of his own innocence and of the
fact that he had never wronged them, he went up when he heard this
news, to try to bring them back by argument; but they no sooner saw him
than they killed him.</p>
<p>One of those who were most grieved by this disastrous uprising was
father Fray Pedro de Sancto Thomas, for he had dwelt for a long time
among this tribe, and had been the vicar and superior of those
churches, and loved each one of the insurgents as his spiritual son.
Hence this misfortune hurt his soul, and he determined to strive to
remedy this great evil as completely as he could, without shrinking
from any danger or effort for the purpose. The places where the
insurgents had betaken themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121"
href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>had been selected as
particularly strong and secure, and were in the midst of mountains so
high and so craggy that they might be defended from the Spaniards, if
the latter should try to bring them back or to punish them. Hence the
journey to them was long and excessively difficult. Yet in spite of
this, without hesitating at the hardships of the road, and at the great
danger which he ran by passing through villages of other
Indians&mdash;with whom he was not acquainted, and who were generally
looking out for an opportunity to cut off some head without running any
risk&mdash;he made his way through everything, went among them alone,
and tried to arrange for bringing them back, and made agreements with
them. No Spaniard dared appear among them, for they were certain to
kill him, but father Fray Pedro was admitted and entertained; and in
the following year, 1622, he brought back in peace with him some three
hundred households of those who had rebelled. These had gone with the
body of insurgents from the villages of Pilitan and Bolo. Most of them
had been compelled to do so, as has been said, and they were
accordingly brought back as a result of the earnest efforts and the
courageous boldness of father Fray Pedro. Returning to a pacified
region, they were settled at the mouth of the river of Maquila. After
this was accomplished, he went further up the river of Balisi, where it
was most difficult, with the alcade-mayor and the troops who were
advancing against the rebels. He went before, trusting in God, to speak
with the enemy; and he was so confident that he was able to say, like
St. Martin among the highwaymen, that he had never had less fear in all
his life, because fear had been taken from him by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>Lord, for whose sake he had placed himself in
this situation. The leader of the revolted enemy, Don Gabriel Dayag,
came to him and kissed his scapular with great reverence, and embraced
him. Repenting for what he had done, Don Gabriel planned to return; and
although at that time he did not carry out this project, he finally
came down in peace later, and revealed to the father some ambuscades on
the road in some dangerous passes where the Indians intended to kill
the Spanish soldiers, which danger was avoided by his information. At
that time this father was vicar-provincial, and, that he might be able
to have more time to attend to these necessary and arduous labors, the
provincial relieved him from the office&mdash;to the great satisfaction
of father Fray Pedro, who esteemed most highly that which was most
laborious and least honorable. He paid little attention to his bodily
health, all his solicitude being given to the spiritual health of
himself and his fellow-men. He treated himself very ill, and would take
no comfort even when he needed it. He never complained when he was
suffering from illness, until the increase of the disease obliged him
to keep his bed, in a condition of such infirmity that, even when in
bed, he was unable to move. The hardships which he endured at this time
by going (always on foot) over very difficult paths were most trying.
The heat of the sun was terrible; he was obliged to be awake much; and
he had but little food, and that bad&mdash;so that nothing could be
looked for except a severe illness or death. He was reduced to skin and
bones, and yet he strove to give himself spirit to return to that
destroyed vineyard, that he might restore it to its ancient beauty and
verdure; but his exhausted strength was insufficient <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>to
resist so severe a disease, and they accordingly had him carried down
to be cared for in the city of Nueva Segovia. The medicines, however,
came so late that he was no longer susceptible to them. Being nothing
but skin and bone, he was like a living image of death. He was greatly
grieved by his sickness, and his grief was greater since the disease
immediately exhibited its deadly malice; yet it was not a rapid one,
and hence he had time for preparation for the dreadful journey. He
received the holy sacraments very calmly, and he made his confession
quite at leisure. Since it was the last one, and there were now no
stumbles to be feared, he declared that he went from this world in the
virginal purity with which he had entered it. He died on the day of St.
Peter the Apostle; on that day he assumed the religious habit; and
finally, on that day he ended this miserable life, in the hope of going
to eternal felicity by the aid of that same holy apostle, to whom he
had always been devoted. This father was a son of the convent of
Villaescusa, and, after a life in Espa&ntilde;a in which he had a
special reputation for virtue, he continued the same course in this
province, with great spiritual progress, for more than twenty years. He
was always beloved by all, and always distinguished in his labors for
the spiritual good of his fellow-men&mdash;not only in Yrraya, but
wherever he lived. This was especially true in the district of
Malagueg, where another uprising occurred, and where, though he was in
great danger of being slain by the insurgents, he showed great courage
and readiness to die for the holy gospel. But here the Lord delivered
him for more labors, greater merits, and higher glory. In the
provincial chapter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124"
name="pb124">124</a>]</span>which followed, the following record was
entered on the minutes: &ldquo;In the convent of our father St. Dominic
at Nueva Segovia, died the reverend father Fray Pedro de Sancto Thomas,
an aged priest and father, vicar of Yrraya. He was beloved by God and
man, and most observant of the rules of the order; and, although he
suffered from disease, yet he underwent the greatest hardships for the
conversion of the Indians and for sustaining them in the
faith.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The voyage of the holy Fray Luis Flores to the kingdom
of Japon</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Father Fray Luis Flores was for many years engaged in
the ministry to the Indians of Nueva Segovia. Though his work was
rewarded with much fruit, he felt that it was not such as he desired it
to be; and he asked and received license to return to Manila, where, by
devoting himself to prayer and the reading of holy books, his soul
might obtain strength to be more fit for his labors. While he was
living in the convent in great quietude of spirit, the news of the
imprisonment of some of our religious in Japon reached Manila;
and&mdash;like that Antonius who, in the time of Constantius the Arian
emperor,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e998src" href="#xd21e998" name=
"xd21e998src">22</a> left the desert and went to Alexandria to confound
the heretics&mdash;father Fray Luis determined to leave his beloved
quiet and to go to Japon. Having received permission to go on this
enterprise, he departed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href=
"#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>without having had any companion
assigned to him. God provided one in the person of father Fray Pedro de
Zu&ntilde;iga,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1003src" href="#xd21e1003"
name="xd21e1003src">23</a> an Augustinian friar who had been driven
from Japon at the time of the banishment of the religious. They
embarked as secretly as they could, June 5, 1620. They dressed
themselves in secular habits, and disguised themselves as completely as
possible. They met with storms and contrary winds, and were obliged to
land at Macan to renew their stores. They re&euml;mbarked July 2, and
on St. Magdalen&rsquo;s day anchored off the island of Hermosa to get
wood and water. They were still within sight of the island when they
were captured by a ship of Dutch pirates. The Japanese, when they saw
that these were Dutch, were at ease because of the peace between the
Dutch and the Japanese; but the fathers and the two Spanish passengers
aboard were in great fear, because of the mortal enmity between the
Dutch and the Spanish. The Japanese tried to hide them in the cargo,
which was almost entirely composed of the hides of deer, many of which
are bought by the Japanese in the Philippinas to be made into breeches.
The moisture caused the stench from the skins to be horrible, and the
fathers suffered much from it during the day and night while they were
there. The Dutch caught them and, suspecting them of being religious,
offered them meat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126"
name="pb126">126</a>]</span>to eat on Friday, and tried them with
theological arguments. They also made prize of the ship and cargo, for
carrying Spanish friars. There were seven other vessels, Dutch and
English, with whom they divided their captives and their booty. The
fathers were threatened with death, and the letters accrediting them to
the religious orders in Japon were found. Although these were in
cipher, they increased the suspicion against them. On the fourth of
August they landed in the port of Firando in Japon, where the Dutch and
English had their factories. They were subjected to a most rigorous
imprisonment and to very severe treatment, being stripped to their
waists with their hands tied behind their backs, and their feet
fastened to some small cannon. The Spanish and Japanese Christians in
Nangasaqui were greatly grieved when they heard of the imprisonment of
the religious; and made plans to rescue them, which came to nothing.
The Dutch were desirous of giving their prisoners to the emperor, for
they wished, as he did, to root out Christianity from Japon, and at the
same time to bring to an end all commerce between the Japanese and the
Spaniards, hoping in this way to have the commerce to themselves, and
caring nothing for the loss of all these souls.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The many efforts made for the rescue of the prisoners
without any good results, and rather to their cost; the martyrdom of
the prisoners.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Several of the fathers who were in Japon made efforts
to rescue the prisoners. At one time father Fray Pedro de Zu&ntilde;iga
and the two Spaniards were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>slipped past the guard, but were
soon caught again and driven back. When the Japanese sent to ask if
they were religious, father Fray Luis sent an answer complaining of the
Dutch for plundering the ship and taking him prisoner, and alleging
that they were rebels and pirates. The Dutch, in anger, determined to
force the father by torture to confess that he was a religious. They
bound his body and let water drip upon a cloth over his face until he
lost consciousness. The prisoners were afterward actually rescued from
prison, but were soon caught again and were beaten. It may be asked how
priests were justified in concealing the fact that they were priests.
To this it may be answered, as St. Thomas says (22, sec. 3, art 2),
that the priesthood is a free state, which may be assumed by anyone who
desires; and when they were asked if they were priests or not, they had
a right to conceal it, or to deny it in some good sense true according
to their own meaning, without following the meaning of him who asked
the question&mdash;which they were not bound to follow, because the
question was unjust. In making this denial they did not deny that they
were Christians. Indeed, they expressly confessed that; they denied
only that they were fathers, as they were not in the natural sense.
This declaration did not scandalize or injure the Japanese Christians.
They were satisfied that it was not a lie, but a prudent and lawful
artifice. As there is a time to be silent, there is also a time to
speak, and as the evidence against father Fray Zu&ntilde;iga became so
strong that the truth could not be denied except to his own discredit,
he confessed in December, 1621. Father Fray Pedro was then handed over
to the Japanese to be put in prison; and father Fray Luis, seeing that
nothing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>would be gained by further concealment,
confessed to the king of Firando that he was a religious of the Order
of St. Dominic. The two friars were imprisoned on the island of
Quinoxima. The other Christian prisoners were visited by a priest, a
Japanese by nation, named Thomas Araqui, who had studied at Roma, but
who upon his return to his own country had apostatized. He was laboring
at Nangasaqui to induce the Christians to recant, that the work of
persecution might be carried on with less bloodshed. On the seventeenth
of August, the fathers and the Japanese who had tried to rescue father
Fray Luis were taken to Nangasaqui. Here it was impossible to find
Christians who would bring the wood for the pyre of the fathers; and
finally the officials found some heathen of low life who lived among
the brothels, who consented to do it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1022src" href="#xd21e1022" name="xd21e1022src">24</a> The
apostate Thomas Araqui strove to pervert the fathers, and the holy
prisoners were offered their lives if they would recant, but they
boldly refused. Finally sentence was passed upon fifteen Christians.
Three, including the fathers, were to be burnt alive, and the others
were to be burnt after decapitation. On the following day, the
twentieth of August, the sentence was executed in the presence of a
great multitude. When the heads of the twelve were shown to the
multitude in order to strike terror into the hearts of the Christians,
the contrary result was attained, for they shouted aloud that the
saints were happy and victorious. The Japanese by the name of Joachim
who suffered the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129"
name="pb129">129</a>]</span>extreme of torture with the fathers spoke
boldly to the crowd, as the fathers did also. The death of the fathers
came by noon; and this great multitude remained there all that time
without breaking their fast, accompanying the saints with prayers and
groans. At this time the women and children went home, while the men
remained to obtain the holy relics, which were kept for five days that
they might be shown to the Dutch as evidence that the sentence had been
carried out. The Christians afterward secured the relics. His own holy
religious order will take care to provide an account of Fray Pedro de
Zu&ntilde;iga. The holy Fray Luis Flores was a Fleming by nation, a
native of Gante (<i>i.e.</i>, Ghent). He went to Espa&ntilde;a in
company with his relatives, and from there to the Yndias, assuming the
habit of the Order of St. Dominic in the convent of the illustrious
City of Mexico. When he came to the Philipinas he was sent to the
province of Nueva Segovia, where he was an excellent minister.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[The first of the religious to join father Fray Thomas
del Espiritu Sancto in prison was father Fray Angel Orsuchi, who called
himself in Espa&ntilde;a and here Ferrer, from devotion to the glorious
St. Vincent. He was an Italian, a native of the distinguished city of
Luca, in Toscana. He was born of noble ancestry and assumed the habit
and was a student in the college of La Minerva at Roma. Seeing the
great lack of ministers of the gospel in these regions, and the great
devotion of this province, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130"
href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>desired to enter it. For this
purpose he went to Espa&ntilde;a under color of pursuing his studies,
that his voyage might not be hindered by his relatives or by the
religious of his own province. He took advantage of his first
opportunity to come to these regions from Espa&ntilde;a, which was in
the year 1601. He was assigned to Nueva Segovia, and after learning the
language reaped a great harvest of converts. Being afflicted by a
severe illness he returned to Manila, where his illness kept him for
more than two years. After his recovery he went to the district of
Bataan. The Lord restored his health to him in response to a vow.
Father Fray Angel learned the language of Bataan, and ministered to the
Indians of this region, without leaving it&mdash;except for a short
time, when he went to Pangasinan as vicar-provincial&mdash;until he was
assigned to the duty of superior of the hospice of our order in Mexico.
In Mexico he advanced greatly in the things of the spirit, and after a
time became very desirous of returning to this province. He took
advantage of the opportunity offered him by the return to Espa&ntilde;a
of the superior of a company of religious, to take his place and to
lead the religious to the Philippinas. In the following year, 1616, it
was proposed to make him provincial, but he himself objected so
strongly that he was not elected. Father Fray Angel was definitor at
this chapter. The news of the sufferings of the Christians of Japon,
and of the glorious martyrdoms of so many religious there, aroused in
the mind of this blessed father such lively desires to go to the aid of
these faithful and courageous Christians that he could neither sleep
nor eat nor take any rest. He submitted his purposes to a religious of
the Society of Jesus named Father Calderon, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>who
had been in Japon almost thirty years. This father approved his
designs; and then father Fray Angel desired his superior to determine
whether or not he should go&mdash;fearing, on the one hand, that his
strength might not be sufficient for the purpose; and being, on the
other, desirous of undertaking this glorious work. His superior
accordingly commanded him to take the journey to Japon. He assumed a
secular garb, and after many hardships and sufferings on the voyage
reached Japon in August, 1618. While he was still studying the language
he was captured by the ministers of Satan on St. Lucy&rsquo;s day in
December, at midnight. With him were also captured father Fray Juan de
Sancto Domingo and a number of Japanese. The fathers admitted that they
were religious, and were sent to the prison of Omura, where father Fray
Thomas de Sancto Dominico and Fray Apolinario Franco, a Franciscan, had
been confined for two years. They were commanded to lay aside their
habits, which they had again assumed, and to dress in lay garments. It
was intended to prevent the Japanese Christians from reverencing the
fathers, but this act of the judges increased the devotion of the
multitude. One of the most devoted of the fathers, father Fray Alonso
de Mena, was betrayed on Thursday, March 14; and was bound and taken,
with his landlord and a number of Japanese, before the judge. He
admitted that he was a religious of the Order of St. Dominic. On the
following day, they tortured a boy until he revealed the hiding-place
of father Fray Francisco de Morales. He was immediately arrested. This
caused much grief among the Japanese Christians, many of whom showed
great courage and boldness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href=
"#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>in confessing their faith. On the
following Sunday, which was Palm Sunday, the two fathers were sent to
the island of Yuquinoxima, where the holy martyrs, Fray Luis Flores and
Fray Pedro de Zu&ntilde;iga, had been burned. In spite of the efforts
of the judges to prevent the faithful from venerating these holy
prisoners, the pious Japanese showed the greatest devotion and
reverence to them. The fathers were thus made happy in their prison;
and father Fray Francisco de Morales sent home a letter to Manila
rejoicing in his imprisonment&mdash;which was very severe, and in which
they were subjected to great suffering for lack of proper food, from
the discomfort of their lodging, and from the indecent and insulting
behaviour of the guard. In the month of August all the prisoners were
brought together to the prison of Omura, and they rejoiced to meet one
another. Soon after was captured the holy Fray Joseph de San Jacintho.
He was seized on the seventeenth of August, 1621; he confessed that he
was a religious, and told his name. On August 19 he was brought
ignominiously bound to the prison of Omura, followed by a crowd of
sobbing Christians.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The arrest of the holy Fray Jacintho Orfanel; the
narrowness of his prison, and the great miseries of it; his martyrdom,

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Though most of the fathers had remained in the cities
of the Japanese, others wandered through the mountains and in thinly
populated places, where they suffered even greater hardships than the
former <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>class, as they ministered to their faithful sons
in those desolate regions. Among these was the holy Fray Jacintho
Orfanel. Being lean, swarthy and tall, it was difficult for him to
disguise himself, since the Japanese are generally short,
broad-shouldered, and fair-skinned. Even if his secular habit had
disguised him so far as his external appearance went, the modesty and
gravity of his behaviour would have been sufficient to betray him.
While he was resting in Nangasaqui for a time to recover from an
illness, he was betrayed by a renegade Christian and arrested. Boldly
avowing who he was, he was sent to the prison of Omura to join the rest
of the prisoners, who received him with the <i>Te Deum laudamus</i>, as
at the entry of a prince or papal legate. Merely to hear the
description of their prison causes horror, it was so small and so
wretched. The persecutors permitted them no materials for writing, and
no implements made of iron, so that their nails and their hair grew
long. They were not allowed to wash or to change their clothes. The
guards were changed constantly, that they might form no friendship with
the prisoners. This severity, which was intended to alarm the other
ministers of the gospel who were in Japon, if there were any, had no
such effect. The imprisoned Japanese showed the greatest courage, and
their wives desired to follow them into their imprisonment. The captive
Christians spent all that time in holy exercises, prayers, the singing
of psalms, the keeping of the hours, and the celebration of the mass.
The conduct of the Spanish prisoners was such as to overthrow the false
opinion spread through Japon by the Dutch, that the fathers were spies
of the king of Espa&ntilde;a. Their sufferings and their martyrdom
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=

prison the fathers wrote encouraging letters to the suffering

condition who were so in virtue, determined to give the habit to some
of the holy Japanese, their companions. Three therefore, among those of
the best capacity and the highest virtue, passed their novitiate in the
prison, and at the end of their year professed. These saintly men
feared that their penalty would be banishment, not death. On the ninth
of September, 1622, the judges called before them many of the
prisoners, offering them life and liberty if they would renounce
Christianity, and at this time they brought before them some of the
prisoners from Omura. As they came to Nangasaqui a great crowd of
Christians came to welcome and escort them. On the following day, the
martyrs were brought out to be slain; there were, in all, thirty-three.
Before those who were condemned to the stake were burned, the others
were decapitated in their sight. There were seven of our order in this

<p class="first">[Father Fray Thomas de Zumarraga and brother Fray
Mancio de Sancto Thomas were greatly grieved that they should have been
left behind when the other fathers and brethren went to martyrdom; but
soon afterward their grief was taken away, and the door of the prison
opened that they might go forth to be executed at Nangasaqui. It was no
small grief to the saints not to see the Christians in the streets, who
had withdrawn themselves from fear of the emperor&rsquo;s edict. The
martyrs died courageously. The holy Fray Francisco de Morales was a
native of Madrid. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span>assumed the habit in the convent of San
Pablo at Valladolid, where he professed and began his studies. He was
afterward a student in the college of San Gregorio in the same city,
and became afterward a lecturer in arts in his own convent. Thence he
went to the Philipinas, where he spent some time as a teacher of
theology and as preacher to the Spaniards in the city of Manila. One
Good Friday some Japanese happened to enter the church; and father Fray
Francisco was so much affected by the sight that when he returned to
his cell he was sighing and sobbing, and repeating, &ldquo;To Japon, to
Japon!&rdquo; At the provincial chapter in the convent in 1602 he was
prior, and was appointed definitor. At this time one of the subjects
discussed was the answer to be made to the king of Sat&ccedil;uma, who
had earnestly begged for friars of St. Dominic for his kingdom. The
holy friar Fray Francisco de Morales was appointed superior to the
missionaries in Japon, by the voice of all. In time of peace he built
many churches; he gained many souls for God, and at last he attained
the martyr&rsquo;s crown. The holy Fray Thomas de Zumarraga was a
native of the city of Victoria in Vizcaya, and a son of the convent of
the Order of St. Dominic in that city. He studied in the college of San
Gregorio at Valladolid. He accompanied Father Francisco de Morales to
Japon and attained an elegant mastery of the language of that country,
in which he lived twenty years, five of them in prison. The holy Fray
Alonso de Mena was a native of the city of Logro&ntilde;o; he was a son
of the famous convent of San Estevan at Salamanca, whence he went out
to the Philippinas. Here he was occupied for some time in the ministry
to the Chinese, and the Lord conveyed him thence to Japon. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>He
suffered from illness for a number of years, and from a profound
melancholy, which did not prevent him from fulfilling his ministry with
great joy. The holy Fray Joseph de San Jacintho was a native of the
town named Villarejo de Salvanes, in La Mancha, and was a son of the
convent of Sancto Domingo at Oca&ntilde;a. He went out to the
Philippinas from the royal convent of San Pedro Martyr at Toledo, when
he had finished his studies there. He was sent immediately to Japon,
where he accommodated himself in all things to the Japanese manner of
life, dressing and eating like the Japanese, employing their
civilities, speaking their language with as much propriety as they, and
in the same sing-song voice. In all this he surpassed the other
fathers, insomuch that he was taken by the Japanese as one of
themselves. The holy Fray Jacintho Orfanel was a Valencian by birth,
and was by his habit a son of the convent of Sancta Cathalina Martyr at
Barcelona. He was a religious of the greatest modesty and
patience.]</p>

<h3 class="main">A mission sent by the province to Japon, and the
result of it</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Though the province rejoiced in having so many
glorious martyrs, it was grieved to see the preachers of the holy
gospel in Japon come to an end, for without them it was impossible for
the faith to be continued. These true sons of our father St. Dominic
strove therefore to fill up the number of those who, after having
fought valorously, had departed to heaven with the crown of martyrdom.
The project <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>was one of great difficulty. The law directed
that not only the preachers should be burnt to death, but that all
those who brought them should suffer the like penalty, and that the
vessels and cargo should be confiscated. The Dutch and English heretics
watched with great care to see if any religious attempted to enter the
kingdom. The emperor decreed that a registry should be kept of all on
board the vessels which came to the kingdom. And finally there were
many, even in Catholic countries, who for the sake of trade with Japon
endeavored to prevent the religious from going to that country. The
commerce of that kingdom with the Philippinas Islands had been almost
destroyed, so that the very archbishop himself endeavored to prevent
preachers from going from these islands to Japon. They were even more
rigorous in Macan. But the holy martyrs from their prisons sent back
calls for religious to aid the Japanese in their extreme spiritual
need. Hence in the year 1623 the superiors of three religious orders
determined to buy a ship, and to give large pay to the pilot and the
sailors to take the religious to Japon. The risk of death was great in
Japon, and scarcely less in these islands, because the voyage was
contrary to the will and the command of the governor. Finally, ten
priests were embarked&mdash;four from our order, four Franciscans, and
two Augustinian Recollects. Many obstacles were placed in the way of
the journey, but the voyage finally took place. The province sent of
its best: father Fray Diego de Rivera,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1102src" href="#xd21e1102" name="xd21e1102src">26</a> a son of
the convent of San Pablo at Cordova <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>who was at the time
teaching theology, as he had done for many years in the college in
Manila; father Fray Domingo de Erquicia, who was at that time the
principal preacher in Manila; father Fray Lucas del Espiritu Sancto,
lecturer in arts in the aforesaid college; and father Fray Luis Beltran
or Exarch, minister to the Chinese and the Indians. They suffered much
on the voyage. They followed the course by the Babuyanes and the
islands of the Lequios, from which they were driven by a storm to the
coast of China, where they took on water and wood at a point named
Sombor. They tried to make port to get fresh ship-stores, but were
attacked by the Chinese. Father Fray Diego de Ribera was shot in the
leg, by accident, by one of his own men, and finally died. On the
nineteenth of June they landed in Satzuma, and were directed to go to
Nangasaqui. They immediately set about learning the language, and had
been there but a short time when the emperor issued a decree expelling
all the Spaniards who had come to Japon from Manila. The fathers
pretended to return to Macan, but left the vessel to come back secretly
to Nangasaqui. The persecution was going on, seventy persons being
martyred in 1623&mdash;among them father Fray Francisco
Galvez,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1107src" href="#xd21e1107" name=
"xd21e1107src">27</a> a Franciscan; and Father Geronimo de los Angeles,
a Jesuit. Father Fray Pedro Bazquez was taken prisoner; and,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>as the other fathers had not yet learned the
language, all the labors of the Dominican order fell upon father Fray
Domingo Castellet. The fathers encouraged the Japanese, a number of
whom confessed bravely and suffered death by burning, among them being
some of noble birth. The accounts of matters in Japon during this
period are drawn in the main from the letters of father Fray Domingo de
Erquicia. The fathers were obliged to be most secret, to go from house
to house by night, and to expose themselves to cold and snow. What
happened to this father and his companion was not known here until
August in this year 1626. We turn from the account of the works of
these fathers to give a narrative of the experience of some who had
been in Japon longer, and who had thus far escaped martyrdom. One was
Fray Pedro Vasquez, a son of the convent of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de
Atocha at Madrid; and the other Fray Domingo Castellet, a son of the
convent of Sancta Catalina Martir at Barcelona. As the persecution
advanced, the Portuguese who lived in the kingdom were expelled from
it.]</p>

license to do so. The ship arrived in Nangasaqui after a voyage of only
eleven days. This was on the twenty-second of July, 1621. Hearing of

<h3 class="main">The election as provincial of father Fray Bartholome
Martinez, and the deaths of some religious</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the nineteenth of April, 1625, the vigil of the
glorious virgin St. Inez de Monte Policiano, the fathers having votes
assembled for the election of a provincial, since father Fray Miguel
Ruiz had finished his term. On the first ballot the votes were divided
almost equally, since there were so many religious worthy of the post
as to cause difficulty in the selection. But this did not last long,
for on the second ballot those who had the largest number of ballots
withdrew, and father Fray Bartholome Martinez was unanimously elected.
He had been vicar of the Parian of the Chinese, and was their special
minister. He was recognized by all, both religious and laymen, as
worthy of this or of greater offices, because of his great virtue,
learning, prudence, and devotion. At the same time no one had talked
about or even thought of such a choice, because, in truth, there were
many others who well deserved the post and who were much older than he.
The Lord, who does not look at these exterior things alone, but at the
heart <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>and the soul, turned their eyes upon this father
as upon another David, so that by being placed in a post of government
he might do great things. It was the Lord who caused them all, as if
moved by a spirit from above, to elect him with great good-will, and
with general applause from within and without the order, all
recognizing the hand of the Lord in a choice which was at once so wise
and so far from the thoughts of all. In particular, the archbishop of
this city was greatly pleased with it, for he knew well the great
virtues of the person chosen, and sent to give his most special
congratulations to the fathers. Father Fray Bartholome was a son of the
famous convent of San Estevan at Salamanca. He was a great theologian,
and a man of superior virtue, devotion to the rules of the order, and
mortification. He underwent many extraordinary sufferings. Some were
voluntarily assumed, and although these were many, they were (as we
shall see afterwards) easier to bear because voluntary. At the same
time, it was necessary to train and try him for much which the Lord
desired to work through his means; and hence the Lord gave permission
to the devil to torment him&mdash;so severely that, when he was still
very young, his hair grew white. In the first year of this assault he
lost his strength, and was dying without suffering from any other
disease. He was living in the convent of novices in Salamanca, and
revealed his sufferings to his confessor and spiritual master alone.
This was the holy Fray Diego de Alderete. He, being of much experience
in such sufferings, consoled and encouraged him, but commanded him not
to speak of the matter with any person. This direction he observed so
carefully that it was never possible to learn any <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>more
than these general facts, although there must have been many very
remarkable things which, if known, would have been highly edifying. But
he, striving for more humility, and obeying the order to keep silence,
never revealed them, and no one else ever knew them. He was seen to be
growing weaker, being without strength and without health, and when he
was taken to the infirmary the physicians corroborated what all knew
with regard to the danger in which he was; but they were never able to
find out the cause, since it was beyond the limits of their science.
All this, and much more which was added to it, was necessary, and
helped him much to bear the bitter hardships which in time he suffered,
and which would have broken his heart. Our Lord conducted father Fray
Bartholome through all his life by a way of suffering, and in suffering
he ended it&mdash;as will be narrated in due time, when we reach the
year of our Lord 1629, when his virtue and his abstinence will be
specially treated. During his term as provincial, the province lost by
death several religious of superior qualities, and suffered from
several insurrections of villages. Both of these things were severely
felt in a region where the religious are so few that the loss of a
single one is a notable loss; and where all energy is turned toward
converting souls, so that the perdition of a single one causes great
sorrow. For these sufferings our Lord brought some comfort in the
martyrdom of some sons of the province, and in the extension of the
holy gospel to the island of Hermosa.</p>
<p>[Among the religious who died at this time was father Fray Francisco
de Cabrera, vicar of San Miguel de Nasiping; he was a native of
Carmona, and a son of the convent at San Lucar, whence he was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>sent to pass his novitiate in Sancto Domingo at
Xerez. He was stationed in Nueva Segovia and was an exemplary minister.
His name is honorably mentioned on the records of the chapter in the
year 1625. At the same provincial chapter honorable mention was made of
father Fray Pedro Blazquez, vicar of the convent of Manavag. He was a
native of Marchena in Andalucia. He assumed the habit of the order in
the famous convent of San Pablo at Sevilla and was sent as a collegiate
to Almagro. He left his convent of Sevilla to come to this province in
1613, and was regarded by those who accompanied him as a saint. On the
fifteenth of May, 1624, died father Fray Thomas Vilar. He was a native
of Castellon de la Palana in the kingdom of Valencia, where he assumed
the habit. He was sent to the college of the order in Origuela, and
came to the Philippinas in 1601. He was assigned to the province of
Nueva Segovia, and afterwards was appointed rector of the college of
Sancto Thomas at Manila. In the following November, as fathers Fray
Miguel de San Jacintho (a man who was twice provincial) and Fray Diego
de Toro, vicar of San Jacintho at Camalaniogan in Nueva Segovia,
testify, a marvel happened in the village of Apari,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1148src" href="#xd21e1148" name="xd21e1148src">28</a> a port
in that province in the district of Camalaniogan. A fire occurred here
one night, and a sea breeze was sweeping it throughout the village,
when the vicar, taking in his hands the little image of our Lady of the
Rosary which they were accustomed to carry in the processions, made a
vow and turned it toward the fire, when the wind immediately died down
and the fire began to go out.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146"

<h3 class="main">Father Fray Juan de Rueda and de los Angeles, who died
a martyr</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Father Fray Juan de Rueda was a native of the
mountains of Burgos, and had assumed the habit in San Pablo at
Valladolid, whence he came to the Philippinas in the year 1603, being
sent, as soon as he arrived, to the kingdom of Japon. Here he assumed
the name of Fray Juan de los Angeles. When the priests were banished,
father Fray Juan was one of those who remained in hiding to aid and
fortify the Christians there. In 1619 he came to Manila in order to
obtain more religious. He reaped a great harvest in Arima. He was
devoted to the holy rosary. He translated into Japanese the devotion of
the holy rosary while he was in Manila. His anxiety to return was such
that he strove to make his way back by the islands of the Lequios,
where his arguments in favor of Christianity convinced those who heard
them that he was a Spanish priest. He was therefore imprisoned for a
time in an island called Avaguni, where he profaned a thicket which was
dedicated to an idol, and for this suffered death, but on what day was
never known.</p>
<p>While this provincial chapter was being held in Manila, there died
in Nueva Segovia father Fray Miguel de San Jacintho, a native of
Caceres in Estremadura. He was a son of the convent of San Estevan at
Salamanca. He volunteered for the Philippinas in 1594, and in Mexico
was elected a superior <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>of the company, the vicar who had
led them having died; he was assigned to Nueva Segovia. He was a most
devoted minister, a diligent student of the language of that nation,
and a most zealous and devoted religious. He prayed the Lord that he
might not die a superior, and his prayer was granted; for after he had
been vicar of many convents, vicar-provincial of Nueva Segovia, prior
of the convent of Manila, and twice provincial of the province, the
Lord called him to himself when he was living in Masi, one of the first
villages which he converted. He died suddenly, on the twenty-fifth of
April. The Indians of the villages of Abulug, Masi, Pata, and
Cabacungan gave him the most costly funeral honors within their power,
and made up a subscription for more than five hundred masses, which at
four reals apiece come to more than two thousand. This they did as a
token of their great love for him, and the great debt which they owed
him for bringing them to the Catholic faith.]</p>
<p>On the eighth of June, the first Sunday after the most Holy Trinity,
a great misfortune occurred in the revolt of some Indians of the
province of Nueva Segovia. Turning their backs on the faith, they gave
it up and fled to the mountains&mdash;a thing which caused great grief
to the ministers of the holy gospel. In that province, above a village
named Abulug, near a river which comes down from the mountain, two
villages had been formed by gathering the inhabitants together. They
were called Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rossario de Fotol, as has been
recounted in this history, and San Loren&ccedil;o de Capinatan. In the
latter there lived some Indians known as Mandayas, a wild and fierce
tribe whose native abode was in mountainous <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>places about the bay of Bigan in Ylocos. The
religious ministered to them and assisted them in their necessities,
taught them the law of God, and baptized many people, for these people
generally asked holy baptism from them. Their evil nature, which was
perverse and restless, and their affection for their ancient places of
abode so attracted them that it seemed as if in that village they were
caught fast by the hair. Three times they endeavored to escape to the
mountains; and though they were prevented twice, and their efforts came
to nothing, this last time they so planned their attempt, and kept it
so secret, that they carried out their evil purpose. With this object,
they stirred up the old inhabitants of Capinatan, and persuaded those
of Fotol, bringing them to join them by means of threats and prayers.
Some of the people of Fotol became so obstinate that they were worse
than the Mandayas, the first movers of the insurrection. Afterward the
Mandayas who were in Capinatan rose; and two of them, Don Miguel Lanab
and another chief named Alababan, set the enterprise in motion by going
to the church to speak to the religious who was there at the time. This
was father Fray Alonso Garcia,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1169src"
href="#xd21e1169" name="xd21e1169src">29</a> a son of the convent of
San Pablo at Valladolid, who had said a first mass in the village of
Fotol, and a second in Capinatan, and was now at dinner with brother
Fray Onofre Palao, a lay religious from the convent of Manila. They
were seated at their meal in a little corridor of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>the
house. Their assailants came up, and each one standing beside the
religious whom he was to decapitate, they made a pretense of asking
permission to go to some villages on their ancient lands. Father Fray
Alonso, who had but recently come, referred the request to the regular
minister of the village, and asked them to wait till he should come,
because he was in another village. At this point Alababan raised his
arm, and with his balanao or knife he struck such a blow on the neck of
Fray Onofre that he cut off his head to the backbone, leaving it
hanging by only a little bit of skin. Don Miguel Lanab, who had not
acted so promptly, lifted his knife, and father Fray Alonso naturally
raised his hand to protect his head. The knife cut through this and the
blow went on and reached his head. Father Fray Alonso rose from the
table and fell on his knees like a gentle lamb; and the Mandaya traitor
repeated the blow, giving him another on the head. The Indian boys who
served at the table began to scream; and the transgressors, that they
might not be caught in so perfidious an act, made their escape. Some
Indians who were ignorant of the conspiracy came, and took father Fray
Alonso to the house of a chief, where some medicines were applied to
the wound. As they were preparing a barge in which to take him down to
the village of Abulug, the Mandayas came, and prevented them from doing
so by threats. They took him back to the house of the chieftainess: and
while father Fray Alonso was exhorting the people to come back to
obedience, and expounding to them the evil of which they were guilty in
apostatizing from the faith, three Mandayas came in, and with their
keen balanaos or knives cut to pieces the confessor of Christ. They
afterward <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>threw out the pieces from the house, to be eaten
by the swine who were there. As a result of this atrocious deed, the
Mandayas rose in a body and roused the Capinatas; and, coming down to
Fotol, they forced the people there by menaces to flee with them to the
mountains. They set fire to the churches, and, as members of Satan,
they defiled them by a thousand sacrileges. They struck off the head of
a Christ, and cut the body down the middle, dividing it into two parts,
which were afterward found by the religious who came to bring them back
to obedience. The religious buried these, the uprising of the Mandayas
(of whose severe punishment we shall soon hear) allowing no opportunity
for anything else. With regard to Fray Alonso Garcia, several matters
worthy of remark were noted. The first was this. Some months before,
while he was living in the convent in Capinatan, he one night had put
himself into the posture of prayer in the dormitory, with his breviary
in his hand. At this time the convent was disturbed by an imp who
caused so much trouble that he would not give the religious any rest,
and from whose visitations there was not in all the convent any place
that was free. He disturbed them in the dormitory, he made a noise in
the cells, he feigned the noise of a struggle in the church; and
sometimes he let himself fall with a clatter that was heard in the
village, and he would throw himself down from the choir. He used to
walk up and down in the church, and he made his appearance in the
larders, where he broke all the plates there were; he made a noise
under the beds, and struck the heads of the bedsteads; and sounded the
strings of a harp which they had for use at masses on some feasts. This
disturbance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>lasted until the breaking-out of the uprising,
and must have been a prognostication of it, and a sign of what the
devil was devising to disquiet the Christians of this village. Now
while father Fray Alonso was praying, the imp came to him, invisible to
everyone in the dormitory, and struck the father a heavy blow, so that
he felt pain in the same hand and wrist, in the place where the blow
afterward fell which cut it off. This was the first of the things
referred to. The second was that he thought so little of himself, and
had so little confidence in his own works, that he was accustomed to
say that if he did not die by some fortunate blow which should take
away his life and despatch him to heaven, he did not know whether he
should go there. This he said because of his humility, and the event
was as he said.</p>
<p>Another matter was that, although father Fray Alonso was not a very
skilful linguist, and not one of those who had made the greatest
progress in speaking the language of that tribe, yet when he was
wounded by the first blows and was urging the Indians not to flee, and
telling them of the harm which would come to them if they did so, he
spoke with such elegance and precision that the Indians were amazed to
hear him; and they noted this as a striking fact at the time, and told
of it afterward. He was very charitable, and was in the habit of
praising all and of speaking of the defects of himself alone. He came
to the Philippinas in the year 1622, and lived in the province of Nueva
Segovia&mdash;where, in his third year, he met with the happy death
which keen knives, directed by hands of apostates from the faith, bring
to ministers of the holy gospel. The intermediate chapter of 1628 made
mention of these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span>two religious in the following words:
&ldquo;In the province of Nueva Segovia father Fray Alonso Garcia, a
priest, and brother Fray Onofre Palao, a lay brother, died happily by
the hands of impious apostates, an uprising of the Indians to whom they
ministered having occurred.&rdquo; In the place where father Fray
Alonso was cut to pieces, there was afterward raised in his honor a
small shrine. The Indians were brought back in the following year, and
this tribe used devoutly to frequent this shrine. The dwelling of the
religious had stood where Fray Onofre had been killed, and here it was
erected again. Since the first building was burned, it was supposed
that the fire had consumed his body at the same time&mdash;although
some Spaniards have some small bones which they value, believing that
these are his, because they found them where he was decapitated.</p>

<p class="first">[The Order of St. Dominic has always had its eyes
fixed upon Great China; and father Fray Bartholome Martinez was
especially anxious for the conversion of that great realm. In this
conversion he was like Moses, who came in sight of the promised land;
for he carried religious and planted the faith in the island of
Hermosa, from which that most populous realm is almost in sight. This
island had been greatly coveted by Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and
Dutch. The king of Espa&ntilde;a was the first to undertake to conquer
it; and by his order there were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>prepared two ships of
moderate size with a force of two hundred soldiers and sailors. The
leader was Don Juan Zamudio, who came to the Philippinas in 1593. He
chose the time of his voyage unfortunately, and was driven back to the
coast of Batan; but he was rescued by the intervention of our Lady of
the Rosary. The emperor of Japon in 1615, after his victory over
Fideyori, sent an expedition against the island. It left Nangasaque in
1616 and wintered in the Lequios Islands. Setting sail again in the
following November [<i>sic</i>], it was scattered by storms upon the
coast of China. The Dutch, desirous of weakening the power of
Espa&ntilde;a and of interfering with the work of the preachers of the
holy gospel, had taken possession of an uninhabited island called
Island de Pescadores,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1197src" href=
"#xd21e1197" name="xd21e1197src">30</a> which lay off the coast of
China. This was in 1624. By the Chinese the Dutch were persuaded to go
thence to another island (Formosa) running from northeast to southwest,
sixty-four leguas in length, and extending from latitude twenty-one to
latitude twenty-five, and being thus twenty leguas in breadth. They
established themselves at the southern point, in latitude twenty-three,
in a port called Taiban, opposite Hayteng in Chincheo. From this post
they could scour the seas and capture the vessels sailing from China.
Here they built a small fort from which they could do much damage to
the inhabitants of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156"
name="pb156">156</a>]</span>Manila and might close very important
gateways to the holy gospel.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1204src" href=
"#xd21e1204" name="xd21e1204src">31</a></p>
<p>In the year 1625 Don Fernando de Silva was governor of the
Philippinas. He determined to send a fleet to take possession of a port
in the island of Hermosa, in the name of the king of Espa&ntilde;a,
that the designs of the Dutch might be frustrated. He counseled with
the provincial of the Order of St. Dominic, Fray Bartholome Martinez,
who promised to go to the island of Hermosa and to take religious
there, hoping in this way to gain an entry into China. In order to keep
the design secret it was said that the troops were going to pacify the
rebellious Indians of Yrraya, who had fled to the mountains. On
February 8, 1626, the fleet sailed from the port of Cavite; it was
composed of twelve champans and two galleys. There were three captains
of infantry and their companies, and the force was under the command of
the sargento-mayor, Antonio Carre&ntilde;o de Valdes. The
ecclesiastical authority was in the hands of the provincial, Fray
Bartholome Martinez, who took with him five religious, including those
whom he later brought from Nueva Segovia. They anchored in the port of
Nueva Segovia on the fifteenth of March, and remained there for some
time. During the interval troops were sent to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>river of the Mandayas, the Indians of which had
rebelled in the previous June, as was said in the foregoing chapter. In
order to reduce them, a great number of palms were cut down, that they
might more easily be brought to subjection for lack of food. Since the
reduction of the Mandayas took more time than was expected, and the
voyage to the island of Hermosa was urgent, this matter was left
without being brought to a conclusion. To carry out their principal
purpose they sailed on the fourth of May, coming in sight of the island
on the seventh of the same month. They coasted the island for three
days, and on the tenth of May anchored on an estuary which they named
Sanctiago. The provincial and Pedro Martin Garay, the chief pilot, went
in two small vessels to the northern headland, exploring the coast.
Within five hours they discovered a port which they called La
Sanctissima Trinidad. They took back the news to the fleet, which came
on to the port and in the divine name of the most Holy Trinity took the
port under the protection of Espa&ntilde;a. They built a fort upon an
islet<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1217src" href="#xd21e1217" name=
"xd21e1217src">32</a> a little more than a legua in circumference. This
they called San Salvador. They also constructed a rampart on the top of
a hill three hundred feet or more in height, which made the place
impregnable. The Dominicans erected a humble church, dedicating it to
St. Catharine of Siena. Here they heard the confessions of the
Spaniards, preached, taught, and filled the office of parish priests,
up to the year 1635. The inhabitants of this region had fled from fear
of the arquebuses of the Spaniards, and desired to avenge themselves
for the wrong which they felt that they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>had suffered because
the soldiers made use of the rice which the natives had left behind
them. To quiet and satisfy them, the religious set about learning their
language; and, although they knew very little of it, they began to
communicate with the natives, caressing them and giving them presents.
The Lord prospered their work, and the barbarians, who had lived the
lives of savages, drinking the blood of their neighbors, and eating the
flesh of their enemies, were tamed by the treatment of the religious.
They brought their wives and children to be baptized. The first fruits
were delicate and tender children, many of whom, after being laved in
the baptismal font, went to enjoy the possession to which they had
acquired a right from the waters of the holy Jordan. The convent of All
Saints of the island of Hermosa was accepted in the intermediate
chapter of the year of our Lord 1627, and was erected into a vicariate,
father Fray Francisco Mola<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1222src" href=
"#xd21e1222" name="xd21e1222src">33</a> being appointed as its vicar
and superior.</p>
<p>On the fourth of February of this year father Fray Alonso del
Castillo, a native of Andalucia and a son of Sancto Domingo de Sant
Lucar, set sail from his convent in the islands of the Babuyanes to go
to Nueva Segovia. The distance is a little more than six leguas, but
the crossing is dangerous at some times. His vessel was swamped, and
the father and those who were with him were all drowned. He was an
abstemious and devoted religious. Father <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>Fray Alonso lived in
the islands of the Babuyanes. He was at one time tempted by a thought
which was unworthy of his state as a religious, and the purity which he
maintained&mdash;the devil urging him to it, and putting before him the
means of carrying out the design, and the method of keeping it in
secrecy during the absence of the superior. Father Fray Alonso,
recognizing from whose bow this arrow had been shot, went to his
superior and told him the temptation of the devil with all the details.
He and the superior laid the matter before God with prayers and
scourgings. The devil was unable to oppose such humility, and in a few
days father Fray Alonso was able to assure the vicar that there was
nothing to fear. In the following April died father Fray Ambrosio de la
Madre de Dios, a native of Guatimala, a son of the convent of Sancto
Domingo at Mexico. He came to the Philippinas in the year 1595, and was
assigned to the province of Nueva Segovia. Without any controversy, it
is he who up to the present day has most accurately learned the
language there, and who was the teacher of those who understood it
best. No one surpassed him in his pronunciation and his choice of
words. He wrote a methodical grammar, arranged a vocabulary, translated
the gospels, various examples of holy life, an explanation of the
articles, the passion of our Lord, and other works highly esteemed for
the elegance of the writing and the propriety of the words. He was a
religious of great virtue, and our Lord wrought many miracles by his
prayers. It was in response to his prayers that when the lime-kiln in
Abulug fell, those upon whom it fell did not lose their lives. In Pata
occurred two cases, as it seemed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>of resurrection; and in
Tocolana he saved the church from burning.</p>
<p>At the last of May, father Fray Diego Carlos, a native of Guatimala
and a son of the convent at Puebla de Los Angeles, died in the same
province. He suffered much at the time of the insurrection of the
Mandayas Indians, whose minister he had been, and whom he had brought
down from their mountains. In the provincial chapter of 1621 he twice
received half the votes in the election for provincial. In the month of
June, father Fray Juan de San Jacintho, a native of Los Guertos in
Segovia, and a son of San Estevan at Salamanca, fell ill in the
province of Ytuy. He lived a devout and a devoted life in the province
of Pangasinan. He was greatly beloved by all. Some Indians of the
province of Ytuy having asked for baptism, he went thither twice,
suffering greatly from the hardships of the journey. The second time,
he fell ill; and it was rumored that the Indians had given him poison,
as they often do. He died at Manila. In the year of our Lord 1627,
toward the end of March, died in the province of Nueva Segovia brother
Fray Juan Garcia,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1236src" href="#xd21e1236"
name="xd21e1236src">34</a> a lay religious, a native of Yebenes in La
Mancha, and a son of the convent of Sancto Domingo at Manila.]</p>
<p>To aid in supplying the want of these noble ministers, and to fill
up the gap caused by the death of many more, our Lord gave us in July,
1626, a re&euml;nforcement of religious, who had been assembled in
Espa&ntilde;a by father Fray Jacintho Calvo, and whom he had entrusted
in Mexico to father Fray Alonso <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"

Visitacion&mdash;a son of the convent at Oca&ntilde;a, who had come to
the Philippinas in the year 1613.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1243src"

of San Jacintho, where he had been sent by the chapter of the year
1623; and he now undertook the charge of conducting the religious,
returning to the ministry of Nueva Segovia, where he had previously
been. He had been appointed by the Inquisition of Mexico as its
commissary for the cases which might arise in the said province
pertaining to that holy tribunal.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For the holding of the intermediate chapter [in 1627],
an ancient custom in the Order of St. Dominic, devout fathers had
assembled. Although the day was at hand, the provincial was absent,
being occupied in the new conversion in the island of Hermosa. He had
not returned from there since the previous year, when he had made the
journey. As the accidents of the sea are so various, the religious were
anxious; but the Lord relieved them from their anxiety on the day
before the holding of the chapter, the morning of Thursday. The coming
of father Fray Bartolome caused joy in all the community; and in
recognition of the good news which he brought and of the labors which
he had undergone, the governor Don Juan Ni&ntilde;o de Tavora, invited
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>him and the fathers who constituted the chapter
to dine with him on the following day, which was Friday. That evening
they discussed that which they were to do on Saturday the twenty-fourth
of April; and on that day they elected as definitors fathers Fray
Balthasar Fort and Fray Miguel Ruiz, who had been provincials; Fray
Antonio Ca&ntilde;i&ccedil;ares, vicar of Babuyanes, and Fray Marcos
Saavedra, a son of Villaescusa, vicar of San Raymundo de Malagueg. By
this time the Indians who not long before had revolted and apostatized
from the faith in Mandayas (and especially those of Fotol and
Capinatan) had been reduced to subjection, and, as a result of the
efforts of the religious, had gone down to their old villages.
Recognizing the error which they had committed, and desirous of atoning
for it by amending their lives, they built churches, re&euml;stablished
the villages, and returned to the quiet which they had enjoyed in their
earlier age of gold, giving up their age of hard iron<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1258src" href="#xd21e1258" name="xd21e1258src">36</a> which
they had been deluded into entering.</p>
<p>[The religious in Japon were at this time greatly afflicted. One of
the persecutors, Feyzo, strove to force his own mother by hunger to
give up the faith from which he was himself a renegade. This man
captured Father Baltazar de Torres, a religious of the Society of
Jesus, who had been his own father in the faith, and imprisoned him. On
the twentieth of July four religious of the Society of Jesus, with five
of their servants, were burned at the stake. The persecution was most
bitter at Omura, where the holy father Fray Luis Beltran (of Exarch)
then was. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>He was a native of Barcelona, and received the
habit in the convent of Sancta Catarina Martir in that city. He was
sent to the college of Origuela, where even during the time of his
studies he devoted himself to prayer and spiritual exercises. He
volunteered for the Philippinas, reaching Manila in 1618. After
learning the language of the Indians of that region, who are called
Tagalos, he also learned that of the Chinese, ministering in both
languages up to the year 1622, when he was sent to Japon to assist in
consoling the afflicted Japanese. He came in disguise, and very soon
learned the language of that country; and he labored for three years
with great effect in the kingdom of Omura. He foresaw that he was to
suffer death by martyrdom. He was serving in a hut of lepers when he
was betrayed to the judge. While in prison his very jailers showed him
respect.]</p>

together with their landlords and others in their house. The bitterness
of the persecution increased, and the ministers of the gospels went out
into the fields, ascended the mountains, and hid themselves in the
caves of the earth. Father Fray Lucas del Espiritu Sancto had no food
for forty days except some boiled roots. The Christians were forbidden
to assemble, and were brought in scores before the ministers of Satan,
to recant or suffer martyrdom. The number of the holy martyrs cannot be
counted. The poor were driven out from their houses, and were compelled
to suffer the rigors of winter, from which many of them died. The
persecution came to be so severe that this year of 1627 was adorned
with martyrs. On the sixteenth or seventeenth of August, eighteen
Christians of all ages and conditions received the palm of martyrdom,
among them father Fray Francisco de Sancta Maria. Among those executed
were some children of three and five years of age. Details are given of
the martyrdoms of a number of Japanese, with the horrible tortures

executed by burning at the stake.]</p>

in hiding from the ministers of the law. It was with great difficulty
that they could be assisted. In the year 1628 the four religious orders
in these islands, the Franciscans, the calced Augustinians, the
Recollect Augustinians, and our order, put forth all their energies to
send religious to Japon as secretly as possible. The expense was
enormous, amounting to more than ten thousand pesos from the common
purse of these four orders. They embarked twenty-four religious; among
these were six of our holy order, one of whom died after two days of
sailing&mdash;father Fray Antonio Corbera, a native of La Mancha, who
had come within a short time to the Philippinas from the college of San
Gregorio at Valladolid. The ship was wrecked by the carelessness of the
pilot. Though the fathers escaped from drowning, two of <span class=

injuries received in the wreck, and from sunstroke after reaching land.
One was father Fray Antonio Ca&ntilde;izares, a native of Almagro and a
son of the convent of our order there, who had labored nobly among the
Indians of these regions for some years.<a class="noteref" id=

was father Fray Juan de Vera, a native of the city of Sancta Fee in the
kingdom of Granada. He studied in Espa&ntilde;a at the convent of San
Pablo at Valladolid. He came to this province, learned the Chinese
language, and was occupied in the ministry to the Chinese when he was
assigned to this duty. The Franciscan fathers, not dismayed by the
failure of this enterprise, strove to make the journey to Japon by
themselves. During two years, no news reached us from Japon, except
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=

principality of Catalu&ntilde;a, October 7, 1592. He assumed the habit
of our order October 23, 1608, in the convent of Sancta Cathalina
Martir at Barcelona. He pursued his studies in the very religious
convent of Sancta Cruz at Segovia, where he showed great ability. In
the year of our Lord 1613, when I was about to make a voyage to the
Philippinas Islands as procurator-general for the province of the Holy
Rosary of the Order of St. Dominic, and when I came to Sancta Cruz at
Segovia searching for religious to accompany me, one of the first who
enlisted was father Fray Domingo Castellet. He was assigned to the
province of Nueva Segovia, where he taught for six years in the new
villages called Los Mandayas. In 1621 he was directed to go to Japon,
where he showed the greatest intrepidity in danger, and wrought a
marvelous work. He was taken by surprise, and was followed to prison by
several confessors.]</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this year, twenty-eight, I came for the third time
from Espa&ntilde;a to the Philippinas, not alone, but with a good
company of excellent religious,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1322src"
href="#xd21e1322" name="xd21e1322src">39</a> who, desirous to advance
themselves in virtue, left their land and their kin and their comforts,
like Abraham, that they might assist in their spiritual necessity,
these tribes which depended so much upon such ministers. There was no
lack of hardships on the way, for the Lord knows of how much importance
it is for us to find persons who will accept these as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>they
ought; He does not lose the opportunity to apply them, and does not
desire that His gift should be useless. When we reached Manila we were
heartily received, for we had been desired because of the great lack
which had resulted from the deaths that had taken away religious just
when they were most needed by the Indians whom we had under our care.
There were also many others under our eyes who still were heathen for
lack of preachers, but who would have been Christians if they had
anyone to teach them the truth and the Catholic religion. The vacancies
were filled up with these re&euml;nforcements. As might be expected of
those who were heartily desirous of converting their fellow men, the
more they labored the more labor they desired; and there were many who
were very eager to go on new missions and to reap new harvests of
heathen.</p>
<p>[The opportunity was offered for making another attempt to convert
Camboja. A Chinaman who had lived in the kingdom of Camboxa brought
word that the good reputation which the fathers of St. Dominic had left
in that country would cause them to be kindly received there if they
went again. The kingdom of Camboxa is the one which has given religious
rites, though false ones, to China, Japon, and the most civilized of
the surrounding nations; and the people of that kingdom are naturally
much inclined to religious devotion. Hence it was hoped that they would
be the better Christians because they were so devout heathen. A letter
was written to the king of Camboxa, asking permission to preach the
gospel in that country. The reply which was received was courteous, but
did not grant the desired permission. At this time the governor of
Manila <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>was thinking of sending Spaniards to Camboja to
build a ship there, because of the excellence of the wood of that
region for such a purpose, and the abundance of workmen there. That the
Spaniards who went might not be deprived of sacred ordinances, he asked
the superior of our order for religious to accompany the expedition.
There were strong arguments against sending the religious to that
kingdom. The Cambodians had twice exhibited their fickleness, having
striven to kill the Spaniards and the religious who had been invited to
enter the kingdom. The same fickleness would make it unlikely that
converts would hold to the faith in times of persecution. The people
were unintelligent, and most vicious; and the country was very hot and
unhealthful. On the other hand, it did not seem consistent with
Christian charity not to take advantage of every opportunity to attempt
to save these people, in spite of their natural fickleness, their low
intelligence, and their inveterate vices. Three religious were
accordingly assigned to this expedition, the superior of whom was
father Fray Juan Baptista de Morales, a son of the convent of San Pablo
at Ecija. He was a master of the Chinese language, which is of great
importance in that kingdom. Two other religious volunteered to go on
this service. They set sail December 21. The voyage, though a dangerous
one, was fortunate; and they sailed four hundred leguas up the famous
river of that kingdom (the Me-Kong River), the source of which is
unknown. The religious were courteously received by the king. Factious
quarrels broke out among the Spaniards, which threatened so grave
results that father Fray Juan Baptista de Morales felt obliged
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>to return with them when they came back to the
islands, for fear of an outbreak on the way. The king refused to give
permission for the baptism of his subjects, allowing only the Chinese
and Japanese to be converted; and the ministers, feeling that they
could be of greater use in these islands, returned to take up their
ministries here, where they have been of the greatest use. This was the
third time that this province actually placed religious in the kingdom
of Camboxa, in addition to the expeditions which set out for that
kingdom but failed.</p>
<p>At this time our religious in Hermosa were engaged in the most
laborious work of all these ministries, the learning of a new and
extraordinary language without grammar or vocabulary, or any other aid
even in the country itself; for at the beginning they were not able by
payment to keep an Indian who would merely permit them to listen to him
as he spoke and to catch up a word here and there. Although at the
beginning these people were like wild beasts, without the least trace
of human civilization, the religious have now domesticated them to such
an extent that they can go among them&mdash;although a few years before
no stranger could enter their country without their drinking his blood
like fierce wolves. Some infants have been baptized, and the children
of some villages, though not baptized, know the creed and pray every
night at the foot of the cross. The children learned to laugh at the
old superstitions, which have a strong hold on their elders. The
hardest thing of all has been to bring them back to their old villages,
from which they fled in fear of the arms of the Spaniards; but as they
learned the gain to be acquired from trading with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>the
Spaniards&mdash;which is a lodestone that attracts hearts of
iron&mdash;they are returning to their old abodes. The religious have
erected two little convents and churches, about like shepherds&rsquo;
huts in appearance. One is near the presidio of San Salvador, in a
native village called Camaurri, and is dedicated to St. Joseph. The
other is half a legua from the village of Tanchuy (<i>i.e.</i>,
Tamsui), and is dedicated to the Virgin of the Rosary.]</p>

Martynez, after building a church in the new city of San Salvador, went
on to Tanchuy, a province of the same island and a port known to the
vessels which come to it from China. It is fourteen leguas from the
chief city in it. When the fort was built there, to which the name of
St. Dominic was given, he was present, doing all he could to prevent
damage to the natives. Many of the latter fled away to Senar, where he
followed them and built a church. The ministry in this province of
Tanchuy was entrusted to father Fray Francisco de Sancto Domingo, a son
of the convent of Zamora. His companion was brother Fray Andres
Ximenez. They went by sea, having a perilous voyage, and were met when
they landed by father Fray Jacintho de Esquivel.] <span class="corr"
id="xd21e1350" title="Source: They">The</span> three went with Captain
Luis de Guzman and some soldiers, to set up in the village of Senar a
beautiful image of the Virgin of the Rosary. They went on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>foot
and with great difficulty, as it had rained the day before and was
still raining, and part of the way they went mid-leg deep. Not a single
soldier said the things which are usually heard on such occasions. On
the contrary, loaded as they were with mud, they comforted themselves
by saying: &ldquo;At last we are going to establish the faith.&rdquo;
The captain, Luis de Guzman, to whom this region owes much, because of
his valor and Christian spirit, and his kind treatment of the natives
in it, marched barefoot, encouraging them and saying: &ldquo;Come on,
my children; doubtless there is much good here, because the beginning
is so hard.&rdquo; A messenger was sent ahead to notify the Indians,
and by their help the streets were covered with branches; they fitted
up a half-castle<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1355src" href="#xd21e1355"
name="xd21e1355src">40</a> with powder, which they had prepared, and
they arranged for a graceful sword dance. When the image, which they
carried as ceremoniously as possible, reached the village, they placed
it in the church. The sky cleared, and the sun came out as if to
rejoice in the festival; and after a mass of the Virgin of the Rosary
had been said, they bore her in procession&mdash;the soldiers firing
off their arquebuses, and the castle discharging its salute, and the
dance being performed in token of the possession taken of this country
by the queen of heaven, and of the conclusion of the devil&rsquo;s
ancient control over it. [The Indians rejoiced greatly, the chiefs
being invited to dine with the captain. After this they gave a ball
after their fashion&mdash;a very disgraceful one in our eyes, because
at every turn they drink a draught of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>very bad wine which
they have. This kind of ball or dance they keep up for six or eight
hours, and sometimes for whole days. The chiefs kept boasting that
their village was the finest in the island, since they had Spaniards, a
father and a church, as the others had not. They desired to return the
invitation of the captain with one to a feast after their own
manner&mdash;which is a repast of dogs rather than of men, since they
eat nothing except meat so rotten that the bad odor of it serves them
as salt. After the feast the soldiers, the captain, and father Fray
Jacintho returned to Tanchui; while father Fray Francisco and brother
Fray Andres remained as a guard of honor to the Virgin. Father Fray
Francisco, thinking that the Spaniards would be lonely without their
holy image, thought best to return it; but the Indians were so much
grieved that it was given back to them, and they rejoiced greatly,
though they were not yet Christians. A great part of the labor of the
conversion fell upon the brother. The Lord wrought miraculous works
through his hands, keeping the sick alive until they might receive holy
baptism, and doing wonderful works of healing. The kindly treatment of
the fathers at last made the Indians feel sufficient confidence in the
Spaniards to return to their previous places of abode, whence they had
fled from fear. One lay brother was in the island of Hermosa for five
years among the Indians, who, although they had not been pacified,
never harmed him. He baptized a number, brought down from the mountains
many who had fled from fear of the Spaniards; and with them formed a
village of moderate size named Camuarri, which is constantly increasing
in numbers, and greatly needs a church.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

elected as provincial of this province, on the first ballot. He was a
son of the convent of San Gines at Talabera, and afterward a student of
San Gregorio at Valladolid. At the time of his election he was
commissary of the holy Inquisition in all these islands, and prior of
the convent in this city of Manila. Since he is still living, we must
be silent about him, and not say the things in his praise which are so
well known, and which are said by those who enjoyed his peaceful and
religious government. In this chapter nothing of importance was done in
laying down ordinances for the province; but there was much cause to
give thanks to the Lord for the peace and quiet with which the
religious strove to fulfil their obligations as members of the order
and as ministers of the holy gospel. The Lord gave them special relief
and comfort, that they might find light and pleasant the great
sufferings which they endured in both capacities. Hence the electors
returned to their posts very promptly, feeling that in them the hand of
the Lord had delivered to them their own profit and that of their
fellow-men.</p>
<p>[At the beginning of the following August occurred the death of the
venerable father Bartholome Martynez, who, being engaged in the
conversion of the island of Hermosa, was unable to attend this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=

a village of Raoja called El Rasillo, a hamlet of some twenty poor
inhabitants. He was a son of Sant Estevan at Salamanca, and a student
in the college of Sancto Thomas at Alcala. He took advantage of the
opportunity of coming to this province in company with the holy Fray
Alonso Navarrete. He gave his chief attention in the province to
learning the Chinese language, hoping to become a missionary to the
kingdom of China. He was so devoted to the Chinese that he was beside
himself with anger whenever a wrong was done by a Spanish soldier to
any Chinaman. As this seemed to be an impediment to the conversion, he
resolved to restrain his anger, and learned, as the law of the Lord
teaches us, to be angry but not to sin. It was father Fray Bartholome
who built the beautiful wooden church in the Chinese Parian. The cost
was above twenty thousand Castilian ducados, and it was all raised by
offerings. The Lord wrought miracles by father Fray Bartholome in the
building of this church, and on other occasions. On some occasions he
displayed the gift of prophecy.]</p>

<p class="first">[Father Fray Bartholome was notable for humility,
patience, penances, and zeal. When he was elected provincial in 1625,
he prostrated himself on the ground, and begged them to put him in jail
rather than make him provincial. His habit was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>poor
and mean, his tunics full of sweat and blood and all tattered. He would
never permit the Indians to carry him across streams or to wash his
feet. He subjected his body to the severest mortifications, beating
himself cruelly and wearing chains of various kinds, some with
sharpened links. He went always on foot, even crossing swollen streams
in this way. He had so accustomed himself to abstinence that when he
felt obliged to set the other religious the example of eating a little
more than was habitual to him, that they might not injure their health,
he suffered greatly as a result. He slept as little as he ate. He
suffered greatly from asthma, but was most patient. Although he was
often insulted on the expedition to Hermosa for interfering with the
soldiers, he overcame all this by his great patience. The Chinese or
Sangleys were devoted to the father, because of his affection for them.
He gave them alms of his poverty, and was once almost drowned in the
effort to rescue some heathen Chinese. In spite of the failure of his
two efforts to enter China, he was not discouraged, but hoped that the
way might be opened through Hermosa. In the effort to carry out the
plan of sending an expedition to Hermosa, he exposed himself to
dangerous storms, but was rescued by the Lord. To bring the expedition
to success, he labored with his own hands like a slave. On the way he
brought from Bigan, on the coast of Ylocos, to Nueva Segovia the
remains of Bishop Don Fray Diego de Soria. The efforts of this father
on this journey seemed superhuman. The soldiers when told of the real
object of the expedition believed that they were deceived, and were on
the point of mutiny. When a storm broke out soon after they had landed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>on the island of Hermosa, and the soldiers were
exposed to hardship, and when the Indians made some resistance, the
soldiers cursed and swore at the father again; but afterward they came
to love him. It was with the idea of getting nearer to the coast of
China that the father suggested that possession be taken of the port in
Tanchuy. It was fortunate that this suggestion was made and carried out
by the commander, Don Juan de Alcarazo; for if they had waited a week
they would have found the port in possession of the Dutch, who came
there with three vessels of war, but were forced to retire. Happy in
the good results of the expedition, the father set sail to cross an arm
of the sea, in a small boat in which there were eight persons, the
father and the commander among them. The boat was caught by a wave and
capsized; five, including the general, were saved, and three, among
them father Fray Bartholome, were drowned. The death of the father
caused great grief among the soldiers, the Chinese&mdash;both Christian
and heathen&mdash;the religious, and all who knew him.]</p>

<p class="first">[On Friday, June 7, 1630, died father Fray Miguel
Ruiz, a son of the royal convent of Sancta Cruz at Segovia, who had
come to the province of the Philippinas toward the end of April in
1602. At the time of his death he was vicar of San Gabriel at Binondoc.
He was several times vicar of the district of Bataan; he was once
vicar-general of the province, was definitor in many provincial
chapters, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>vicar-provincial, several times prior of Manila,
and provincial of the province, which office he filled with justice and
gentleness. He was a devout religious, much given to penance, and
indefatigable in teaching the Indians&mdash;in whose language, in
addition to a book of the Holy Rosary which was printed, he wrote
several tracts, made the abridgment of the grammar which is still
printed, and made a careful vocabulary, which at the end of his life he
was desirous of augmenting. It was said that he died by poison, given
him by a person whom he had chastised for scandalous living. It is most
likely that the pains in the stomach from which he suffered came from
the fogs which are so common in the Philippinas.</p>
<p>The persecution in Japon had reached such a point that it was
impossible to enter the kingdom. The religious orders did all in their
power to replace the holy martyrs with new laborers. They went to great
expense for this purpose, and many religious died in the effort to make
their way to Japon; but the kingdom remained so closely shut up that
their efforts were without result. Information as to the condition of
affairs there in this year 1630 was received from father Fray Lucas del
Espiritu Sancto. The religious in the empire were even unable to meet
one another, and were hunted from place to place, exposed to wind and
weather. Under these circumstances the peace between the religious
orders was of great utility to the ministers in Japon. The religious
were constantly exposed to being captured, being obliged to lodge in
the houses of renegades and heathen; but the constancy and devotion of
the fathers caused even these men to respect them. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=

of idolatry. Every false sect was tolerated, Christianity alone was
persecuted. Among the fathers in Japon at this time was a native
Japanese, who had completed his course in arts and theology in the
college of Sancto Thomas at Manila. He profited well by his studies,
and had been given the habit, had professed, and had passed through all
the orders. He had been taken by father Fray Bartholome Martinez,
during his term as provincial, to the island of Hermosa&mdash;not to
remain, but to make his way from there to Japan, if possible, by the
islands of the Lequios. He was dressed after the Japanese fashion, with
two swords, and succeeded in making his entry into Japon, from which he
wrote a letter to the provincial, dated January 3, 1630. In this he
says that he reached his country on the eve of St. Martin; but that he
has been unable to get into communication with his superior, who was at
that time father Fray Domingo de Erquicia. He later writes that it is
dangerous to send letters, because of the severe punishment of those
who are caught with letters of the fathers upon them. If it had not
been for the return of this father in this way, no information would
have been received with regard to the fate of Father Juan de Rueda in
the islands of the Lequios.</p>
<p>The third religious at this time in Japon was father Fray Domingo de
Erquicia, who also sent back a letter in this year. He says that the
savage persecution which was designed to root out Christianity from
Japon made many weak, but brought out the bravery of many noble
martyrs. In November, 1629, father Fray Bartholome Gutierrez, of the
Order of St. Augustine, was captured in Arima; and in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>same
month there was captured in Nangasaqui a father of the Society of
Jesus, named Antonio. Somewhat later an Augustinian Recollect named
Fray Francisco de Jesus, and afterward his companion, Fray Vicente de
San Antonio, were captured, a mountain having been burnt over in
pursuit of them. Father Fray Domingo de Erquicia writes that a man
recognized him and set out to betray him, but that he was rescued by
the courage of his landlords. In March, 1630, they captured a brother
of the Order of St. Francis; so that there were in that year five
religious imprisoned in Omura, together with forty lay Christians,
besides those in Nangasaqui. In his letter father Fray Domingo gives a
record of the executions of which he knew. The total within a year and
a half is over two hundred. In this year the daire<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1406src" href="#xd21e1406" name="xd21e1406src">41</a> (who in
Japon is like the pope in our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183"

various causes for offense against the emperor, caused his hair to be
cut off, to indicate that he renounced his high office&mdash;something
that, it is said, had never been seen in Japan; and thus that realm is
now without a head in spiritual affairs. No Dutch ship came to Japon in
this year, and the Dutch who had come in the two previous years were
all put in prison. The Japanese desire that the Dutch surrender to them
the fort which they have in the island of Hermosa, where some of them
have been sent, while others remain in Japan as hostages.]</p>

<p class="first">[Though sufferings and persecution refine the gold of
the church, yet there are many rich and pure spirits who appear in time
of peace. Of these latter we are now to give an example. There were but
few years in which father Fray Matheo de Cobissa lived in this
province. He reached the province toward the close of July, 1628, and
was sent directly to the island of Hermosa where he spent less than
three years, but those were full of glory. Fray Francisco Mola,
vicar-provincial of the order in Hermosa, and Fray Angel de San
Antonio, vicar of the convent of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184"
href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>All Saints in that island,
wrote a formal certificate testifying to the facts in the case of
father Fray Matheo. They give an account of the marvelous visions which
the father beheld, in which the Lord explained to him what was to come.
The Lord had previously revealed the future to him, giving him notice
beforehand of the coming of the English fleet to Cadiz in 1625; of the
great inundation in Espa&ntilde;a in 1626; and of the unfortunate death
of the reverend father Fray Bartholome Martinez, the provincial, on his
return from the island of Yama. To these fathers the dying father gave
an account of other visions that he had had. He told them further that
his rigorous penances had never weakened his bodily strength. He
received the extreme unction, and told the fathers who were listening
that when he was coming from Espa&ntilde;a he saw by the mizzenmast of
the vessel the patriarchs St. Dominic and St. Francis, and that he had
had a vision of the three holy kings. Not satisfied with this evidence
uttered by this father&rsquo;s mouth, these fathers added other
information. Father Fray Angel told of cases which had been revealed to
him by father Fray Matheo, in confession, which he had received
permission to publish for the glory of God. Such were the coming of the
Dutch enemy against Tanchuy and the death of the provincial. When the
fathers asked if his dreams, which signified that which was to come,
were always clear, or were of indistinct figures, he answered that they
were generally clear; but sometimes only such that he could understand
that something was prognosticated, though he could not tell immediately
what it was. He was most devoted to prayer, and most rigorously
abstinent. Father Francisco Mola testified <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>to
the religious devotion of the friar. Brother Fray Andres Ximenez, who
accompanied the father from Espa&ntilde;a and was very intimate with
him, testified to his life of mortification and penance, and to his
devotion. He was reckoned a saint, and the high esteem in which he was
held in this province is shown by the words of the provincial chapter
in recording his death.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The entrance made from the island of Hermosa to the
great kingdom of China by two fathers of St. Dominic.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[If this island were of no value, its spiritual
promise would make it important; and if it were poor in material
things&mdash;and it is not, because it has many mines of gold and
silver, and is fertile&mdash;it would still be well that our nation has
set foot on it. It is of spiritual use because it is from hence, as it
appears, that the conversion of the great kingdom of China is to have
its rise. It is of importance in a material way, because of its
nearness to the trade of that kingdom, which is so rich and so
abounding in merchandise. That both spiritual and temporal ends might
be attained, Don Juan de Arcara&ccedil;o,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1447src" href="#xd21e1447" name="xd21e1447src">42</a> who was
commandant of the island at that time, decided to send an embassy to
the viceroy of Hucheo, the capital of the nearest province, with a view
to opening up trade with it, but without saying anything about
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>matters of faith. He offered our religious an
opportunity to go on the embassy. Two religious were accordingly
sent&mdash;the father vicar of the convent, Fray Angel Coqui, a
Florentine by birth, who had assumed the surname of San Antonino; and,
as his companion, father Fray Thomas de Sierra, who was called here
&ldquo;de la Magdalena.&rdquo; He was a native of Cerde&ntilde;a. His
natural gifts were but small, but his spiritual ones were great, as
will be seen. They set out accompanied by two soldiers and seven
Indians, carrying their letter of embassy and a present for the
viceroy. They took what they needed to say mass, and a very little
money for their support; and embarked (December 30, 1630) in two very
small vessels. On the way a heathen Chinese, master of the vessel in
which the religious were, planned to kill them in order to rob them.
The signal being given, the Chinese killed five of the members of the
expedition, and wounded two with the clubs which they used as
weapons&mdash;for, among the Chinese, soldiers only are permitted to
carry weapons of iron. Father Fray Thomas was one of those who lost his
life. The narrative may pause for a moment to give some account of him.
He was a native of Cerde&ntilde;a, and a son of the convent there. He
was destined to the Order of St. Dominic from his mother&rsquo;s womb.
Since the schools in his part of the country were not very good, he
strove to be assigned to the province of Andalucia, and went to the
convent of San Pablo at Cordova. Hearing of the devout manner of life
of the religious in this province, he desired to enter it, and departed
from Espa&ntilde;a in the year 1627, at which time I was bringing over
a body of religious. This was the third company which I led
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>(besides the first, in which I came with others
under leadership, which is now about forty years ago). I accepted his
application, thinking that he could complete his studies in this
province as well as in Espa&ntilde;a. He was of most gentle and patient
disposition. He suffered greatly from headaches, and was unable to
carry on his studies, though in some cases of moral theology he showed
ability. He was sent to the island of Hermosa, in the hope that the
cooler climate would benefit him. His health improved, and he devoted
himself to learning the mandarin language, which is the language used
in China by the learned, and takes the place of Latin among us. Nicolas
Mu&ntilde;oz, a native of Mexico, a soldier, was one of those killed at
this time. He was a man of the greatest piety. God in His infinite pity
delivered father Fray Angel from this terrible danger. He fled to the
cabin in the poop, and there he and the three others who survived were
able to defend themselves against the seventeen Chinese, who fastened
them up there, hoping to kill them of starvation. The vessel was
captured by pirates, to whom father Fray Angel owed his liberty and his
life. The mutineers on the vessel told the pirates that the persons in
the poop were captives taken in lawful war, whom they were going to
sell into slavery. The pirates planned to make an assault upon them,
but decided not to, because they would be certain to meet with some
damage, and resolved to scuttle the ship, leaving the captives to
drown. They took off the sail and the rudder, anchored the vessel that
it might not be carried ashore, and abandoned it. The prisoners were
left fastened up and unable to get out, while the vessel filled with
water up to the poop. The imprisoned <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>men found a chisel in
the cabin, with which they worked a hole between two boards, and
finally escaped from their confinement. They made their way to an
island, and on the other side found an arm of the sea wherein there
were many vessels, among them a fisher&rsquo;s boat. They went up to
the fishermen, who fled from them, but who came back again in response
to their prayers, and let them have some food. These men warned them
not to stay on that island that night, for fear of tigers; and said
that if they survived until morning they would meet with other worse
tigers&mdash;namely, soldiers from the fleets which were always moving
about that coast, who would certainly kill them. In fear of both
dangers, they asked the fishermen to take them to terra firma, and to
bring them before some mandarin. A thousand difficulties were raised
which were quickly conquered with a few bits of money which had escaped
the recent robbery. Being brought before a mandarin, they were sent to
the city of Ziumcheo with letters of safe-conduct and provision for the
journey&mdash;which according to the custom of this kingdom, is
afforded to every poor man who in any way comes to it. The letter which
accompanied them described them as four robbers who had been caught on
the seashore. The second mandarin before whom they were brought sent
them to the third; and he despatched them to the viceroy, forty leguas
away in the city of Ucheo. Father Fray Angel was taken ill, as a result
of all his hardships, but recovered by the help of God. As all the
papers had been lost, the viceroy directed the father to return to the
island of Hermosa for satisfactory credentials, providing him with a
vessel and everything necessary for the purpose. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span>The
father, unwilling to leave China, and being afraid that the viceroy had
some design against him, sent in his place a Christian Japanese who
understood the mandarin language very well. He was one of a number who
were scattered over China, and who desired to make their way to a
Christian country. He dressed this man in a religious habit and caused
him to pretend to be ill, so that he might be left quiet in a dark part
of the ship. By the laws of the kingdom the father thus exposed himself
to death or to perpetual imprisonment, which in China is a prolonged
death. The curiosity of the Chinese is such that nothing escapes it.
The viceroy, the mandarins, and all knew of the return of the father,
and even knew where he was lodged; but no disturbance arose, and the
authorities paid no attention to the matter. The father decided to
change his dress, and to assume such a one as was worn by the most
honorable of the natives, who pay great attention to such matters. He
permitted his hair and beard to grow in their manner, as some fathers
of the Society of Jesus have done&mdash;who have performed many useful
labors here, as is known throughout Europe. During four months the
father was unable to say mass, having been robbed of what was
necessary.]</p>

Domingo father Fray Marcos de Saavedra, a native of Villamayor in the
district of Veles, a son of Sancta Cruz at Villa Escusa in La Mancha.
He left Espa&ntilde;a in 1623, in which year he was ordained priest in
Mexico. He was a minister in Nueva Segovia, and understood the language
of the natives very perfectly. He composed in it a book of sermons for
the whole year; and a grammar for those who might learn it later,
abbreviating the old grammar. He was a devout and zealous religious,
and patiently suffered the long illness which preceded his death.</p>
<p>On the seventh of May in this same year father <span class=

Juan Rodriguez departed from this wretched life for a happier one, in
the convent of Sancto Domingo at Nueva Segovia. He was a native of the
bishopric of Salamanca, and assumed the habit in the famous convent of
San Estevan in that city. After he finished his course in arts and
theology, he was assigned to the convent of Sancto Domingo in the city
of Guadalaxara. He was a friar of exceptional devotion and received
great favors from the holy Virgin and from St. Joseph and St. Dominic,
who visited one of his penitents and directed his life. With the
approbation of the Lord, father Fray Juan desired to go to the convent
of the order in the town of Aranda de Duero, which was famous for its
observance of the rule. Here he was master of the novices, and hence he
was called by God to this province. He was sent to Nueva Segovia, where
he learned the language of the natives, and within five months was able
to preach to them in it. He was much beloved by the natives, and also
by the religious, who all desired to be in his company. His devout and
exemplary life edified all wherever he went. After he had been attacked
by an illness which proved to be his last, he was sent with some
Spanish soldiers to bring back some Christians Indians who were in the
mountains, and who wished to return, but were prevented by their
neighbors, who threatened them with death. In spite of his illness, he
accepted the responsibility and went with the troops. The soldiers,
growing impatient with the delay of the Indians, who feared them,
desired to capture them with the aid of some friendly Indians who
accompanied the expedition. The father, however, persuaded them to wait
for another day; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192"

succeeded by his gentleness and his arguments in persuading those
Indians to give up their lost way of life and to return. There were in
all more than one hundred and thirty persons. After his return his
illness grew rapidly worse, and he died in the month of May.]</p>

<h3 class="main">A second expedition made by two fathers to the
province of Sinay, otherwise known as Ytui, and the result of it.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Eighty years had passed since Christianity was first
planted in this country in the island of Lu&ccedil;on, the chief island
of the Philippinas. From here it had spread to other islands; and in
Lu&ccedil;on it had spread from one province to the next, for in this
one island there are many nations and languages. Yet the province of
Ytui<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1487src" href="#xd21e1487" name=
"xd21e1487src">43</a>&mdash;as we shall call it in future, since it is
better known by that name&mdash;had not had the good fortune to receive
regular preaching before this late date, namely, the beginning of the
year thirty-three. This delay was not due to the fault of the natives,
for they have often manifested a desire to receive the gospel, and have
asked several religious orders for ministers to teach them; but to the
fact that all the orders were so poor in ministers, on account of the
great number of people whom they must aid. That country also is so
rough and so difficult of access for the visitations of the superiors,
that all the orders have avoided assuming the charge of it. For some
years the order of the glorious father <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span>St. Francis sent
religious there to cultivate it, but without any good result. They made
a beginning, but could not carry it on&mdash;some of the fathers being
taken away by death, and others leaving the region because of sickness.
The natives have constantly persisted in their request for ministers of
the gospel to teach them, and have been particularly urgent with our
sacred order&mdash;because they have some commerce with the province of
Pangasinan, which is in our charge; and because they know how much that
is advanced in all matters, both temporal and spiritual, as a result of
the labors of the fathers who minister to it, though the population was
previously the most barbarous known in these islands. Once, some years
ago, some chiefs came here to Manila during a chapter when a provincial
was elected, to place their request before it. The fiscal of the king
(who was also that of the royal Chanciller&iacute;a), Don Juan de
Bracamonte, offered a petition to the definitors, supporting this
request for ministers for that province, since the Indians were vassals
of the king and paid him their tribute, and his Majesty was bound to
provide them with Christian instruction. The answer was a hopeful one,
saying that if his Majesty would send ministers from Espa&ntilde;a they
would then very readily be assigned to this duty, as he desired; but in
the meantime the order could scarcely fulfil the requirements of the
regions which they had already in charge, for the Indians were many and
the ministers few. On another occasion when the father provincial of
the province, Fray Baltasar Fort, was making his visitation to this
province of Pangasinan, the inhabitants of Ytui learned of the fact;
and there came to meet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>him, in a village called Calasiao,
some thirty of the chief Indians of that country&mdash;among them he
who was, as it were, their king. He brought with him his wife and his
sister; and they proffered their request with much feeling and many
tears, complaining of their misfortune that when they were so
near&mdash;the provinces were about four days&rsquo; journey
apart&mdash;they were not worthy to receive the fathers, though they
had several times striven to obtain them with all possible urgency. The
provincial could but feel pity when he saw these heathen Indians
becoming preachers to us, in so urgently persuading the preachers to
come and teach them the law of God; yet he was totally unable to give
them what they asked, but gave them his promise that he would do so as
soon as possible. They returned to their country with this answer, very
disconsolate. Father Fray Thomas Gutierrez&mdash;a minister who was
then in Pangasinan and of whom an account will be given
later&mdash;learned of this, and volunteered to undertake an expedition
thither. A second father, Fray Juan Luis de Guete, offered to go as his
companion. The father provincial granted their request, in spite of the
need of them that would be felt in the posts which they left; but he
commanded them that they should go at this time simply to explore the
country, and should return within a few days to report their opinions
to him, according to the impression made upon them by the natives. They
did this, and went about through the villages of the province, setting
up in the public squares large crosses, to the great delight of the
Indians; this act was a token that the fathers took possession of them
for the Lord who was crucified on the cross. That the devil might
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>begin to give up his ancient possession of the
natives, the fathers taught them the worship which they should perform,
and some prayers out of the &ldquo;Christian Doctrine&rdquo; translated
into the language of Pangasinan. That language they half understood,
though it was different from their own. They understood it all so well
that they immediately began to say the prayers they knew, around the
crosses, seated on cane benches which they made for the
purpose&mdash;two of them intoning the prayer, and the rest repeating
it. With these excellent beginnings, which gave proof of the fitness of
the soil for receiving the seed of the faith, the two explorers
returned to report to their superior as he had commanded them, and
offered themselves anew to return to that region. The provincial, when
he heard their report, was not unwilling to grant their pious desires,
although it seemed that these were contrary to what the strength of the
province could sustain. So trusting in the power of God, and with the
permission and benediction of the father provincial, they prepared
themselves for the return; but they were interfered with by someone who
disturbed them by indiscreet zeal, for the devil sometimes appears
clothed in the garments of an angel of light. The project was not
carried out, but not from the fault of the order or of its sons, who
are not accustomed to be slothful before such opportunities. Perhaps
those peoples were not yet ready in the sight of God for that which
they desired; for in such matters the what, the when, and the how are
understood by God alone and are determined according to His divine
foreknowledge. The natives of Ytuy were not weary of being persistent
in presenting their requests, as in such matters it is well
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>to be. It happened that in the month of December
in the year 1632 the father provincial, Fray Francisco de Herrera (now
commissary general of the Holy Office for all these Philipinas
Islands), was traveling in that region on his visitation to the
province of Pangasinan. The natives of Ytuy, who must have had scouts
to inform them, learned of this; and there immediately came in search
of him some twenty-four Indians, four or six of them being leading
chiefs in the province. In the name of all the rest of the natives,
they put forward their old request. He did not make them the answer
which they had received before&mdash;&ldquo;Wait, wait again;&rdquo;
but gave his instant approval, drawing strength from the weakness of
the province&mdash;which, in the matter of laborers, is great for such
a harvest as it has upon its hands, and as it sees every day
increasing; and which, therefore, has to pass by much for lack of
ability to achieve it all. The father who seemed most suited for this
mission was father Fray Thomas Gutierrez, who some years before had
filled the office of explorer in this country. His companion was father
Fray Juan de Arjona,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1499src" href=
"#xd21e1499" name="xd21e1499src">44</a> a son of the convent of San
Pablo de Cordova&mdash;a man of middle age, but of more than middling
spirit. They both took up the enterprise with great delight, without
any objections or requests; and went back with the Indians who had come
thence, taking no larger outfit than was absolutely necessary to equip
them for the journey. This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href=
"#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>chapter will give a brief account
of the events of the journey and their arrival at Ytuy, drawn from a
letter written by both fathers and dated at Ytuy January 21, 1633. The
letter was directed to the father provincial, and contains the
following narrative:</p>
<p>They left Pangasinan for Ytuy December 6, 1632, the day of St.
Nicholas the bishop; and since there is but little communication
between the two countries&mdash;none at all, in fact, except that
occasionally some natives on each side visit the other&mdash;there is
no open road from one to the other, since the Indians have no need of
one, making their way like deer through the thickets of the mountains.
By their account, the journey takes four days; but this is estimated by
their mode of travel, which is twice as rapid as ours. Father Fray
Thomas was so eager to reach that region that he even wished to make
the journey shorter, and he asked the Indians if they did not know some
short cut. One of them responded that he did; the father asked him to
guide them, and they all followed him. This was in an evil hour, for
the short cut did nothing but to increase their labor, as it took them
out of their way. The journey occupied nine days, over mountains and
across valleys, and through rivers, streams, and marshes, which they
came upon at every step&mdash;for the guide did not know where he was
going, and yet they were obliged to follow him. The provision which
they carried was but for a few days, since they did not expect so long
a journey, and they carried it all on their own shoulders that they
might not burden the Indians. Since the journey took twice as long as
they had expected, they became very <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>hungry, and thus
suffered much, hunger being added to exhaustion. The sky was not kind
to them on their journey, for it rained constantly on all these days
and they had no protection; and the ground was as cruel, for the
thickets abounded with leeches who attached themselves to the faces,
the hands, and the feet of the travelers, and drew blood like a
physician&rsquo;s blood-letting. The Indians were not distressed by any
of these things, or by the necessity of carrying the fathers on their
shoulders across rivers or very bad places in the road, which shows the
pleasure and affection with which they were taking the religious to
their country. The fathers endured this no less well, being certain
that they were not putting into a torn sack what they suffered for
God.</p>
<p>They derived some relief from their sufferings from one happy
circumstance provided them by God, who seemed to have designed all
these wanderings. This was that in the midst of these wildernesses they
found a tiny village of Christian Indians; for this jurisdiction was
under the charge of other ministers, but was very little visited by
them, since it was at so great a distance and over so rough a road.
They baptized two children, and heard the confessions of some
adults&mdash;among them that of a woman who had not confessed for some
years, having no one to confess to. Though she seemed well and healthy,
she died that same day. This was a marked token of her predestination.
They finally reached the principal village of the province, which is
called Ytui, and takes its name from the village. The Indians received
them with great demonstrations of joy, after their manner; and they
remained there for eight days resting, and receiving visits from all
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>villages in the province, who sent ambassadors
to bid them welcome with some presents of the fruits of the country.
They set out afterwards to visit all the villages in it. Great and
small, they visited eleven, that they might become acquainted with the
temper of the Indians. In all they were received with the same tokens
of pleasure. From what they saw and learned from the Indians, they had
much to say in their report of the excellence of the country. They said
that it was cool, so that by day the sun&rsquo;s heat was pleasant at
times, and a covering was agreeable at night. This is something new in
these islands, which have the fault of being very hot. They reported
that the country was so fertile that when Indians desired to plant
their rice they only burn over a part of the mountain<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1512src" href="#xd21e1512" name="xd21e1512src">45</a> and,
without any further plowing or digging, they make holes with a stick in
the soil, and drop some grains of rice in them. This was their manner
of sowing; and, after covering the rice with the same earth, they
obtained very heavy crops. They said that some good fruits grew there,
and that in their opinion that country would yield all the fruits of
Spain, if the seeds of the latter were planted. There were, they
affirmed, pleasant valleys with quiet rivers and streams in them from
which the natives obtain some gold, and that the Indians are wont to
wear golden earrings. They are not acquainted with silver, and do not
care for it. They have no sort of money, so that all their sales and
purchases are carried on by barter. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>keep their villages
very clean and in good condition&mdash;a new thing among the Indians.
They also remarked that there was great fraternity between different
villages. This is something even more unusual, for generally these
nations live after the law of &ldquo;Might makes right&rdquo; [<i lang=
"es">viva quien vence</i>], at the expense of their heads. Hence these
Indians walk alone over their roads without fear of being injured or
robbed, for they are very safe in this respect&mdash;so much so that
they leave the rice which they gather, each one in his own field,
heaped up in the spike and covered with straw. They go there and carry
what they want to their houses, to grind and eat, without fearing that
anyone will take what is not his. They readily offered all their
infants to the fathers to be baptized, so that within about three
months, during which the religious went about visiting the villages,
they baptized some four hundred. It would have been the same with the
adults, if it had not been necessary to prepare them with the
catechism. The fathers have been slow in this, because they have been
obliged to translate the prayers into the native language, of which
they have not a good command. They are spending their time in learning
it, and on this account and no other are delayed in beginning baptism.
In order that so few ministers may be able to teach the Indians, it is
necessary to bring them together into a smaller number of villages,
conveniently arranged so that the people may be visited and helped in
their necessities. Since the country is very mountainous, the fathers
have determined to bring and gather them in large settlements, at sites
convenient for their fields, near a river which rises in this country,
and which, increased by others, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"
href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>grows to be a very large
stream, crossing the whole of Nueva Segovia to the ocean.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1526src" href="#xd21e1526" name=
"xd21e1526src">46</a> This river, on account of its fish (upon which
most of the Indians live), is also of great value to them. This is the
only point as to which they are somewhat obstinate, because they are
greatly grieved to leave their ancient abode. However, most of them
have accepted it, and it is hoped that the rest will come, and in this
way in a short time much will be gained by the aid of the Lord. Through
the mountains next to this province, which are many and very rough,
there wander a tribe of Indians known as Alegueses, a vagabond people
having no settled places of abode. Father Fray Thomas sent word to them
by an Indian chief of Ytuy that if they wished to come and settle one
of the new sites which he indicated, he would receive them there as
sons, and do them all the good he could. They answered in the
affirmative, and he waited for them for some time; but before they came
the holy man finished his days, full of years and of heroic works, as
will soon be seen. This is the work which these apostolic men of God
accomplished in only three months, as appears from the aforesaid
report. They conclude their report with another case similar to that
referred to above, of the woman who died so soon after she had
confessed. In the goings-out and comings-in of the fathers among the
Indians that they might become acquainted with them, they found in one
village, called Palar, a very aged Indian woman who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>was
dying. She had eaten nothing for five days. Father Fray Thomas went to
see her, and began to talk with her of becoming a Christian for the
salvation of her soul. He expounded to her briefly what she had to
believe, and called upon her to repent of her sins. She answered as
well as might be desired, and he accordingly baptized her on that day,
which was the last day of her earthly life and the first day of her
Christian one. It was a happy day, so far as can be judged; for, being
newly baptized, she had merely to be recorded in purgatory. Not only in
these new provinces where the dawn of the gospel&rsquo;s light now
begins to shine do extraordinary cases happen like those which have
been mentioned, to the great glory of God and the joy of his ministers;
but they also occur in many others where the dawn has risen high but
has not yet bathed all the horizon, though it is covering it, little by
little. From the province of Nueva Segovia father Fray Geronimo de
Zamora,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1531src" href="#xd21e1531" name=
"xd21e1531src">47</a> a native of the city of Zarago&ccedil;a, wrote me
a letter dated February 25, 1633. In it are these words: &ldquo;Before
Lent I went up the river of Mandayas&rdquo; (this is the name of a part
of that province), &ldquo;to try to teach many Indians who were without
Christian instruction in heathen darkness, but who paid tribute to the
king our lord as his vassals, without even being sons of the Church. I
asked them if I might visit them, and they received my request kindly
and asked that I or some other father should remain among them. In
token of the heartiness of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href=
"#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>their wish, they gave me, as a
sort of hostages, ten sons of their chiefs to be baptized; and after
having sufficiently instructed them, I baptized them, to the great joy
and delight of my soul. I hope in God that in this way thousands of
them may be redeemed from the power of the devil, for there is no one
who will declare that they are not his.&rdquo; He afterward asked aid
from his neighbors to draw the net which was laden with so many fish as
are promised by the casts already made there. Many are needed, but we
may say here, &ldquo;Where are those good men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not to be understood that only these new events are the good
ones, or that among Christians who have been so for some time there are
but few occurrences to rouse joy. This is not the case, for there are
so many which have occurred among these latter that a very large book
might be made of the account of them, if it were necessary to report
what has happened hitherto, and what happens every day anew, to the
holy old ministers of the gospel who have been and are among them,
whose beards have grown, and whose hair has become white among the
Indians. They are good witnesses to this truth, and to the growth that
the Spirit is wont to cause in these clods of earth. As for those who
grow weary quickly and leave the ministry, there is no necessity to say
anything. It is certain that among those who have been Christians
steadily for years there are fewer dangers; yet the care of them is of
no less merit, and consequently the reward will be no less, since, as
King David has well said (I Kings, xxx), <i lang="la">Aequa pars erit
descendentis ad praelium et remanentis ad sarcinas, et similiter
divident</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1541src" href="#xd21e1541"
name="xd21e1541src">48</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href=
"#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>Here in Manila the order has under its care a hospital for the
Chinese, in which the sick of that nation are cared for. The province
may place this at the head of its possessions, since there is scarcely
a day in which some soul or souls of newly baptized do not pass to
heaven. Very few are they who die without baptism, and very many are
they who give their souls to God before the baptismal waters are dry on
their heads. This is accomplished with so little effort on the part of
the minister that it calls upon him only to make a little effort, and
to go from his cell to the infirmary. I do not know whether there is
any other hospital in Christendom of the character of this hospital,
its principal end being the cure of souls, while for the cure of bodies
it has its physician, its medicines, and everything needed within its
gates, besides the food and the dainties called for by the palates of
the sick. The effects of the divine predestination which are beheld in
it are so many that they are almost ordinary, and are therefore not
mentioned.</p>
<p>[In Japon the persecution was increasing in fierceness, and very few
letters were received. One of these, from father Fray Domingo de
Erquicia, gives an account of the death of the emperor and the
succession of his son, who was even more cruel than the
father.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1553src" href="#xd21e1553" name=

Society of Jesus&mdash;the remains of all being burned, and the ashes
cast into the sea. On another occasion two Augustinian Recollects were
burned. Two Franciscan fathers were captured, while two Dominicans were
hidden in caves or cisterns, and did not see the sun or the moon for
many days. From a Dominican at Macao, Fray Antonio del Rosario,
testimony was received as to the great achievements of father Fray
Domingo Erquicia.]</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter XLIV</h3>
<h3 class="main">The life and death of father Fray Thomas Gutierrez,
vicar provincial of the province of Ytuy</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Father Fray Thomas Gutierrez was a native of the city
of Origuela in the kingdom of Valencia; and he assumed the habit in the
convent and college of the order there. When the opportunity offered he
went to the province of Sant Hipolito de Oaxaca in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a.
Here he learned the language of the Mistecs, whose minister he was for
some years. Coming to the Philippinas, he was assigned to the province
of Pangasinan, where in a few months he learned the language so well
that he surpassed many of the very natives. He rebuked the vices of the
Indians with such efficacy that they called him &ldquo;Thunder,&rdquo;
because he frightened them like the thunder, which they greatly fear.
He was a rigid observer of the rules of the province and was notable
for his modesty. He went courageously among the savage Indians, who
often attack those who are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href=
"#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>traveling along the
paths&mdash;not for their purses, but for their heads, he who cuts off
the greatest number being the most highly esteemed among them.] On one
occasion he came to a village of these Indians called Managuag. While
he was there, more than four hundred of these Zambales, as they are
called, appeared in the village, with their bows, arrows, lances, and
daggers such as they use&mdash;which are so keen that in a single
instant they strike a head to the earth. They came into the
unsuspecting village with such a noise and shout that the poor
inhabitants, being unarmed, almost died of fear. Some fled to the
mountains, and some sixty Christian Indians took refuge in the house of
a chief. When they saw that they were lost, having no weapons nor any
means to defend themselves, they put themselves in the hands of God,
and decided to make use of prayers in place of weapons; so they fell on
their knees, and began in a loud voice to pray in their language. The
Zambales, hearing them, surrounded the house and undertook to go up to
it. Without knowing what held them back, they were several times
obliged to retreat when they were half-way there. They finally set fire
to it, though against their will, for they thought much of being able
to take with them the heads of its inmates. It was burned to the ground
in a few moments, with those who were within. Although God did not
deliver them from the fire, He showed by a miracle that He had
delivered them from the fires of hell, and perhaps from the fires of
purgatory, exchanging those for this fire; for they were all found dead
in a circle, untouched by the fire, and on their knees, with their
elbows on the ground and their heads on their hands. Most of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>them took refuge in the church under the
protection of the father and of God. These availed them; and the
father, without attempting to close doors or windows, took in his hands
a Christ that was on the altar, from whom he and the people (who were
about him) all begged for mercy, which the Father of Mercies granted
them. It was a marvelous thing that though the cemetery in front of the
church had a wall the height of which was only from a few palmos up to
two varas, the enemy were unable to cross it; and one of them, who
leaped over it, was struck dead by a stray arrow. The roof of the
church and the convent was of nipa, which is like so much dry straw to
the fire. Upon it fell many brands and more than fifty burning arrows,
none of which kindled it, though it was so inflammable. God, choosing
to show who it was that defended this place, by the prayers of His
servant Fray Thomas, permitted an Indian who was with him in the
church, and who thought he was not safe there, to go out, thinking that
he might escape by running. The enemy caught him and cut off his head
in an instant. Not an arrow touched even the clothes of one of those
who remained with the father, though these fell as thick as grass, and
though many arrows passed among them, for they came in at the doors and
windows of the church like showers of rain. Finally the enemy,
frightened&mdash;although, being barbarians, they could not
understand&mdash;when they saw that the fire would not catch, though
there was nothing to prevent it, and that their arms would not injure
these people, though disarmed, retreated with some heads (the spoils
which they most desire) and with some captives. The father, when the
disturbance was over, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href=
"#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span>immediately set about burying the
dead and putting the village in a situation to defend itself from any
other similar attack.</p>
<p>On a mountain chain near two villages, one of which is one of the
most important in the province of Pangasinan, which are called
Binalatongan and Balanguey, there were some unpacified Indians so
savage and barbarous that they knew no occupation but cutting off
heads. They were even more cruel than the ones just referred to, and
came down into the valleys, to the fields of the peaceful Indians and
to the roads, to hunt the latter like so many deer. Father Fray Thomas
was much grieved by this, and did not know what to do to prevent it. To
keep them back by arms he had not the strength; and, as for arguments,
these were not people who would accept them. He therefore made use of a
means which the event showed to have been revealed to him from above,
because according to carnal reason it seemed to be very contrary to the
rules of prudence. He directed two Christian Indians to go up the
mountains to the settlements of their enemies, totally unarmed, and to
carry to them a certain message from him. They went, for the Indians
did not know how to refuse to do what the father directed them; but
they went as if they were going to the slaughter. When they came to the
place, they made signs of peace; but the barbarians, who knew no more
about peace than about theology, were on the point of killing them
without listening to them. But one of the savages themselves diverted
them from this purpose by saying that they would better listen to them
first; that there would be time to kill them afterwards, because they
could not escape. They called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209"
href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>our Indians, and asked them
what they wished; and they answered that they were bringing a message
from father Fray Thomas their father; this was, that he begged them
earnestly to do no more harm to these Indians their neighbors, who were
to him as sons. He desired them to come down and settle in the plains
wherever they pleased, promising that he would regard them likewise as
his sons, and would show them great kindness. They were not acquainted
with the father, and did not know his name; and some of them were of
the opinion that they had better slay the simple ambassadors. Others,
contrary to their usual practice, defended the latter, treated them
well, and showed them hospitality. Among those who were thus kind to
them were two chiefs, of whom one&mdash;who was, as it were, the leader
of all&mdash;was named Duayen; the other was named Buaya. Their hearts,
which were harder than the hearts of tigers, God softened without any
other application than that which has been described. They sent back
his ambassadors to the father with an escort to defend them in
dangerous places, and to take them safe to his presence; and by them
they sent the answer that they were very ready to do with a good will
what he commanded them, and that they would come down to the plain and
settle in three places, so situated that the father might visit and
teach them. They did not delay in carrying out their promise. They
built their villages, and in them churches and dwellings for the
father. In one of the churches were baptized immediately a son and two
daughters of Duayen, together with many other children, twenty of them
boys. Thus was sown the seed of the gospel, which has grown
luxuriantly, at no further cost than has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb210" href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>been recounted.
Father Fray Thomas was indefatigable in striving for the good of souls.
For the benefit of souls he made journeys of <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1578" title="Source: twelves">twelve</span> leguas on foot, over
very bad roads and in the heat of the sun. He sometimes went among
warlike Indians who cut off the heads of others, while he and those who
went with him saved theirs. It seemed to his companion, when he took
one, that even though the companion was weak, a contagion of strength
went out from the father, so that his associate was able to follow him,
and they both went on long journeys without being much exhausted.
Father Fray Thomas was not grieved that the direction of his superior
occupied him in different posts, and called him from one place which
was already cultivated well to another which was not so, but very
ill&mdash;an effect which might have resulted from various causes. In
the province of Ylocos&mdash;which is next to that of Pangasinan, and
between it and that of Nueva Segovia, all of them being in this island
of Lu&ccedil;on&mdash;there is a large village called Nalbacan, the
instruction of which was entrusted to secular clergy. As they were
quickly changed, one after the other, and as some of them did not know
the language of the natives, the village was in great lack of religious
instruction. The bishop of these provinces, Don Diego de Soria,
determined to give this village to the order, that it might minister to
it. The father provincial who held that office at the time, charged
father Fray Thomas with this duty. He set out there immediately, and
began on the way to learn something of the language of the country, of
which he had already a vocabulary and a grammar. Though it is different
from that of Pangasinan, he preached in it at the end <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>of
twenty days after he arrived there, and before the bishop and other
priests who were there, and before the natives, to the wonder of all.
He began to fill his office so acceptably to the Indians that some came
from the most remote parts of the province to confess to him and to
receive his counsels. He was given the name of &ldquo;the holy
father,&rdquo; and, whenever they spoke of him, they used this name. As
this is the appellation of the supreme pontiff of the church, whom the
Indians had never seen, and still less had any dealings with him, those
who were not acquainted with the secret were surprised to hear them
speak until they came to understand it. Father Fray Thomas remained
here a year, and his teaching and example were easily perceived in the
improvement of the Indians and of those who were under his direction.
All this province of the Indians is under the care of Augustinian
fathers, who have in it many places where they give Christian
instruction. They accordingly claimed this of Nalbacan, which was the
only place outside of their jurisdiction. The order was very willing to
yield it, and in exchange for it the Augustinians gave to our order
another, which they had among our ministries in Pangasinan; and thus
each order remained with its province complete, with its own tribe and
language. When the Augustinian fathers came to take possession of the
house of father Fray Thomas, as they did somewhat in advance of the
time, he departed with nothing but his cloak, his hat, his breviary,
and his staff, setting out for the province of Nueva Segovia, which was
very near, to wait for the order of his superior, and to be disposed of
as he pleased. Desiring not to be idle in the interim, for he did not
wish to be idle a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212"
name="pb212">212</a>]</span>single hour&mdash;and if he did not know
the language he would have to be idle many hours&mdash;he learned the
language of that country with the facility which God had given him. He
was aided by the fact that the languages of these three provinces of
Indians are somewhat alike, and resemble each other in their idioms and
in their syntax&mdash;which does not seem to have been invented by a
barbarous people, but by a race of intelligence and keenness of mind.
He remained but a short time in this province, being sent by the order
of his superior to his former province of Pangasinan, whose language he
understood as if it were his mother-tongue. In this language he wrote
many books of devotion, sermons, and treatises, which he distributed
while he was alive among the fathers who were ministers to that people;
and he left others behind him at his death, as his estate, for he had
no other estate except instruments of penance. From these long journeys
on foot, through these rough and hot regions, a sickness resulted in
Pangasinan which threatened to be the last of his life, and obliged him
to give up the ministry to the Indians, much against his will. He
suffered from this very much more than from the pain of the illness;
but what he could not gain in this life he laid up for the other by his
admirable patience and fortitude. Finally God restored his health,
without medicines or comforts, for which there is little provision
here; and there was less then, because things were nearer the
beginning, when everything was barrenness and extreme poverty. With all
these merits, he still lacked one thing to fill up the measure of his
deserts. The common enemy of souls guessed this, and once appeared to
him, while he was reading a book of devotion, in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>hideous and shocking form; and although the
father made the sign of the cross, the enemy did not flee so quickly
but that he had time to say that, if it were not for the stones on the
father&rsquo;s neck, he would be revenged upon him. This was the
rosary, which the father took off neither by night nor by day, that he
might be at all hours armed against him who may attack at any hour, and
will do so whenever he is permitted. His zeal for souls increased with
age, contrary to what often happens; for with the old age of the body,
the weakening of the strength, and the increase of infirmity, old age
often attacks the spirit&mdash;as St. Paul says (Hebrews, viii),
<i lang="la">Quod antiquatur et senescit prope interitum
est</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1590src" href="#xd21e1590" name=
"xd21e1590src">50</a>&mdash;which is as true of the spirit as of the
body. When the father had reached the age of seventy years, he implored
father Fray Francisco de Herrera, who was provincial at the time, to
send him to Japon on the occasion when the large mission thither was
planned which, afterward, God did not see fit to permit to be carried
out. I think that this was not the first time that he proffered this
request to his superiors. In proportion to the dangers and hardships
promised by this mission, of which father Fray Thomas was not ignorant,
was his earnestness in the desire to be a member of it. This is a proof
of his vigorous spirit in venerable old age. His urgent request was not
admitted, on the ground of his age; but he did not lose the merit of
it, since he made it without any hypocrisy. God preserved him for
another mission (that described in the previous chapter), which he
undertook in the province of Ytui. He had made a beginning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>there in former years, but had not carried it on
because of the obstacle there mentioned. He had now come to three years
beyond seventy, and undertook the difficult expedition already
described with as much spirit and energy as if he had only half his
years. Yet he was much bowed with infirmities, as well as with age; and
between them he seemed, as he walked, to be dragging along his body and

not inappropriate, <i lang="la">Senex puerum portabat; puer autem senem

desired to carry to all regions, directed him and strengthened him, so
that he undertook enterprises so far beyond the strength of one bowed
with years and infirmities. In this period of his life he began to
learn the language of this province, accomplishing his purpose in three
months, and beginning to preach to the natives in it. He went to attend
them in their spiritual needs whenever they summoned him, however far
away he was, without heeding rain, or sun, or difficult roads. Though
very compassionate to all, he was rigorous to himself alone, and that
throughout his life. Every night he took a rigorous discipline; and
never after he entered the order did he eat meat, except in case of
grave necessity. He did not complain of his food when it was scanty or
ill prepared, in sickness or in health. To the fasts of the order he
added others. After the festival of the Resurrection he added another
Lent up to Whitsunday, and another afterwards to the day of our father
St. Dominic, so that the whole year was to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>him
fasting and Lent. On Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays throughout the
year, and on the eves of the festivals of Christ our Lord, of the
Virgin his most holy Mother, and of our father St. Dominic, and of the
saints of the order, he fasted on bread and water. As a result he
possessed that which follows such fasting&mdash;a heroic degree of
chastity. Finally the last illness of his life came upon him, being
occasioned by a fall from a precipice, while he was in the work of his
ministry. During the whole time of his illness, his companion could not
persuade him to accept a sheet of very coarse cotton, or to permit his
bed to be changed. On the bed which he had in health, which was a frame
of cane-work covered with a patched blanket, he desired to await the
hour of his death. Before his death he made a general confession,
covering his whole life from the time before he reached years of
discretion. Though his confession covered so many years, it lasted
about a quarter of an hour. After he had most devoutly received the
other sacraments, he died in the Lord, March 30, 1633. The following
provincial chapter, in giving notice to the province of his happy
death, said: &ldquo;In the province of Ytui father Fray Thomas
Gutierrez ended his days, an aged priest and father, most observant of
the rules of the order, severe to himself and most gentle to others. He
labored in this province for the good of souls for the space of five
and thirty years, with such devotion that the very Indians, by whom he
was most beloved, held and regarded him as pious and a saint. This
aroused the ill-will of the devil, who appeared to him while he was at
prayer; and the wicked enemy was able to arouse in him great fear and
terror, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>not to harm him, because he found him protected
with the impregnable rosary of the Virgin. Of him we have the pious
faith that, full of years and of virtue, he has flown to
heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter XLV</h3>
<h3 class="main">The election as provincial of father Fray Domingo
Gon&ccedil;alez, and the state of the province</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the sixteenth of April in this year 1633, the
fathers of the province assembled in Manila to elect a superior. Their
minds were in such agreement that without difficulty they unanimously
elected, on the first ballot, father Fray Domingo Gon&ccedil;alez,
prior of the same convent, not one vote being lacking for the election
but his own. He was very acceptable to the estates, both secular and
ecclesiastical, of this region, as have been all of the other
provincials; since the electors have always exhibited great zeal for
the good of the order, and have made their choice without considering
personal predilections. In general, the election has not previously
been discussed, so that the provincial is elected before anyone
suspects who he is. Often a person is elected with regard to whom no
one imagined any such thing, so that the city is not a little edified.
He who was elected at that time was in Espa&ntilde;a a student at the
college of San Gregorio, where he was for many years a teacher of
theology. After filling all the offices of the order, he became
commissary of the Holy Office in these islands&mdash;as he still is,
with which we must bring to an end all that may be said with regard to
him.</p>
<p>The provincial and the definitors found nothing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>to
occupy themselves with in the reformation of the province. Advice was
received of a new ordinance of the chapter-general held in Roma in
1629, in which permission is given to the provinces to discontinue the
intermediate chapter as being the source of much expense and trouble to
all the order&mdash;and, in this province, of much interference with
the systematic instruction of the Indians in our charge, many of whom
are entirely without ministers during the whole time spent in coming to
these intermediate chapters. In their place were very prudently
substituted the councils, which, being reduced to a much smaller number
of religious, the picked men of the province, are almost as useful and
much less expensive, and are not followed by the bad results spoken of.
This permission was accepted, and the precedent has since been
followed.</p>
<p>In this year the order was extended so far throughout these kingdoms
that it had never before reached such limits. Although the number of
the religious of this province is very small, they have taken up a
jurisdiction so extended and so large that, even though many hundreds
and even thousands of companions were to come to their aid, they would
have enough to provide all these with labor, without needing to seek
for or even to accept anything else, all of them being occupied with
that which has already been acquired and gained. For the lack of
ministers, the Indians are still untaught, and remain in their heathen
state; while if they had ministers they would embrace and follow the
law of God, as those have admitted and professed it who by the favor of
heaven have been able to obtain ministers.</p>
<p>[The persecution in Japon was still increasing in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>intensity and cruelty. The authorities of Japon
now offered a reward of a thousand taes (which amount to almost as many
ducados of Castilla) to anyone who would reveal the place of hiding of
a minister, in addition to full pardon for all offenses previously
committed. Besides this, a new and dreadful method of execution was
devised for the Christians, inasmuch as their crime was regarded as so
vile that the ordinary methods of execution&mdash;decapitation, or
burning alive over a slow fire&mdash;should not be used as a punishment
for them. The condemned Christians were hung, head downward, in a pit,
in such a manner that they could not move their bodies, and that the
blood ran out of their mouths, noses, eyes, and ears until they bled to
death in horrible torment.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1627src" href=
"#xd21e1627" name="xd21e1627src">52</a> In this way father Fray Domingo
de Erquicia was martyred. Father Fray Jacobo de Sancta Maria,<a class=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>habit in our convent of Manila, August 15, 1624,
was martyred in this year. He had returned to Japon in 1632. He went by
way of the islands of the Lequios; and the champan in which he traveled
with some Japanese fathers of the Society encountered storms, and was
cast upon the shores of Coria. The sufferings of this voyage were such
that his hair turned gray. At the end of five months he reached
Satzuma, where he labored for about three months. His father, who was a
Christian, was tortured by water until he revealed the place where his
son was hidden; and on the seventeenth of August father Fray Jacobo
died, after three days of torture, by the method of hanging described.
In this year two preachers of our order made their way to Japon. One
was the glorious martyr, father Fray Jacobo; the other was a Sicilian,
a very thorough master of the Chinese language, who was called Fray
Jordan de San Estevan. He had assumed the habit in Sicilia, after
having studied arts and theology in Aragon and Castilla. He barely
escaped capture immediately on his arrival; and the whole crew of
Chinese who had been hired to bring him were executed for the crime of
bringing a priest into the kingdom.</p>
<p>In this year, thirty-three, the cruel old emperor died; and in the
commotions which followed it seemed as if all parties turned their
hands against the Christians. Many other martyrs of other orders were
executed at this time. Among them were Father Manuel Borges, of the
Society of Jesus; fathers Fray Melchor and Fray Martin, Augustinian
Recollects&mdash;Spaniards, who were caught before they learned the
language; father Fray Jacobo Antoni, a Roman, of the Society of Jesus;
fathers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>Fray Benito Fernandez (a Portuguese) and Fray
Francisco de Gracia, of the Order of St. Augustine; and a Japanese
father of the Society named Pablo Saito, who had accompanied father
Fray Jacobo from Manila. In this year father Fray Thomas de San
Jacintho reported that thirteen religious were captured in Nangasaqui,
besides two of the Order of St. Francis who were prisoners in Usaca.
Besides these, there were Fathers Antonio de Sousa and Juan Mateos, and
Father Christoval Ferreyra, all Portuguese <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1654" title="Source: Jusuits">Jesuits</span>; father Fray Lucas
del Espiritu Sancto, a father of our order; besides many Japanese, both
lay and religious.</p>
<p>Father Fray Lucas del Espiritu Sancto was a son of the convent of
Sancto Domingo at Benavente. An account is given of his labors in the
chapter dealing with the year thirty-one. From his prison he wrote an
account of his labors and travels in Japon, in which he told how he had
gone through the most distant parts of the empire from east to west.
Most of these fathers and many of their companions were tortured while
in prison, and father Fray Lucas wrote a long letter describing their
imprisonment and torture. In this letter he makes the following
statement: that if he should die on the day of St. Luke, he would be
exactly thirty-nine years of age; that he assumed the habit in 1610 in
the convent of Sancto Domingo at Benabente, whence he went to study at
Trianos and hence to Valladolid, coming to the Philippinas in 1617, and
being assigned to duty in Nueva Segovia. He reached Japon in 1623. His
letter is dated October 16, 1633, and two days later he was put to the
torture of the hanging described, being respited for a time and
afterward executed.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221"

del Espiritu Sancto, Fray Jacobo de Santa Maria, and three or four lay
brothers, should be added another who, though he did not die in Japon,
died on the journey thither, at the hands of traitorous heathen. This
was father Fray Jacintho de Esquivel. He was a Basque by nation, noble
in lineage and nobler in virtue. He assumed the habit in the convent of
San Domingo of the city of Victoria. While he was a novice I happened,
in returning from the chapter-general in Paris in 1611, where I was
definitor for this province, to rest in his convent for a week; and at
that time he conceived the desire to come to this province. He was sent
to the famous college of San Gregorio at Valladolid, and distinguished
himself in his studies, becoming a teacher of arts when still very
young. In Manila he was appointed as lecturer in theology in the
college of Sancto Thomas; and in this position he did not take
advantage of the dispensations allowed, but rigorously observed the
severe rules of the province. While he was teaching <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>theology he studied the Japanese language, under
the teaching of father Fray Jacobo de Sancta Maria. With his aid he
printed, at the expense of the college, a Japanese-Spanish
vocabulary&mdash;a large book, which required very great resolution and
labor. As a result of abstinence, he had lost the sense of taste. He
dressed poorly and roughly, and his modesty and chastity were such that
he once said that he had never looked a woman in the face. In order to
make his way to Japon he went to the island of Hermosa. On the very
night of the arrival of father Fray Jacintho occurred a heavy storm,
which overthrew a small convent of ours with its church, which had been
erected in the Parian of the Chinese. The other fathers attributed this
to the wrath of the devil because of the coming of the father; but he
rejoiced that materials were provided for building a church in Taparri,
for which the ruins of these buildings might be used. This village of
Taparri was populated by the worst tribe in the whole island; for they
were all pirates, who committed as much robbery and murder on the sea
as they could. It was less than a legua from the presidio of San
Salvador, and strict orders had been issued that no one should go there
without permission, and that those who went should always go in company
and armed. The father asked permission to go and build a church in that
village, where he soon learned a few of the words. When the Indians
asked him where his wife and sons and land were, he answered that the
religious had none, to which they replied that he was a great liar. At
another time, when he told them of the resurrection of the dead, they
called him mad. Afterward, when they came to have a great deal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>of affection for him and offered him several
marriages, and saw that he would not accept them, or even admit a woman
into his house, they began to believe in him. He afterward set about
building a church in another village on the same coast, nearer the
presidio, and named Camaurri. He established peace between the two
villages though they had always been enemies before. He was afterward
sent to Tanchuy. He lived a life of great mortification, and labored
strenuously to learn the language of this country. In a few months he
succeeded, and made a grammar and a very copious vocabulary. Being sent
back from Tangchuy to Sant Salvador, he obeyed most readily, and his
labors were attended with great results. He exposed himself to dangers
by sea and by land, and preached to Spaniards as well as to Indians. He
established in the island of Hermosa the holy Confraternity of La
Misericordia. The good cavalier Don Juan de Alcaraso gave four thousand
pesos for the purpose; and father Fray Jacintho gave two thousand,
which he had received in alms. He also established a school for the
bright Chinese and Japanese children, and those of other nations in
that country, where they might be taught the matters of our faith, and
where those who are capable of them might learn Latin, the liberal
arts, and theology. He hoped thus to train up children who might carry
the faith into China and Japon. He finally embarked for Japon in a
Chinese vessel, with a Franciscan; and after they had been at sea for a
few days the Chinese, unwilling to wait and put them ashore in Japon,
killed them and took their noses and ears to the judges in Nangasaqui,
who paid them liberally.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href=

Sancto Domingo in the island of Hermosa, and the death of the venerable
father Fray Angel de San Antonino in Great China.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[In the course of time arose a persecution of the
Christians in the island of Hermosa. An Indian chief in Tanchuy excited
some villages to rebel, and to kill some Spaniards from an ambush. They
first employed their weapons upon the holy martyr Fray Francisco de
Sancto Domingo, who had never done them anything but kindness, and who
had just rescued from prison the man who excited all the others. This
man had been placed there because his evil purposes had been detected.
Father Fray Francisco was a native of Portugal, and a son of the
convent of Zamora in the province of Espa&ntilde;a, whence he went in
1615 to study theology in the royal convent of Sancto Thomas at Avila.
He came in my company on the second expedition which I made with
religious from Espa&ntilde;a to this country. He was assigned to duty
in Nueva Segovia, where he learned the language of the natives, and
labored gloriously among them for some years. He was a lean man but had
very good health and great strength. He was taken by the father
provincial, Fray Bartholome Martinez, as his companion, and the
conversion of the island of Hermosa was begun. He suffered from
headache, in addition to which he subjected himself to the most severe
penances. He was most kindly and charitable, especially to the Indians.
When the Indians attacked him, he sank on his knees before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>them; and they shot at least fifty arrows into
his body. The Indians cut off his head, leaving the tongue and lower
jaw on the body; and with the head and the right hand they went to the
mountains, to celebrate the festival of head-cutting. On the way the
head wept miraculously, and there was a dreadful earthquake, so that
the Indians in alarm cast the head into the river. The holy martyr died
January 27, 1633, the Lord working miracles upon his body after his
death.</p>
<p>In this same year, there died in Great China father Fray Angel de
San Antonio, who before coming to this province used his family name,
which was Quoqui (or Cocci). He was of noble Florentine descent. Some
mention of his virtues has been already made, when I spoke of the
entrance of our order into the kingdom of China. By the assistance of
miracles, he succeeded in carrying out the great desire of the province
to preach the gospel in that most populous and wealthy country, the
people of which have so much intelligence and such fine natural gifts.
He was minister to the Indians of Bataan, whose language he understood;
but by the direction of his superiors he undertook the study of the
Chinese language, and, in spite of its difficulty, he obeyed with
alacrity and promptness. Before he had thoroughly mastered this
language he was sent to Hermosa, from which the governor, Don Juan de
Alcaraso, sent him on an embassy to the viceroy of Ucheo. The treachery
of the Chinese on the way has already been described; and an account
has been given of the events which occurred in China. In the year in
which the order sent him a companion (1633), he was taken sick, and
died.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=

<p class="first">Although the conversions of the kingdoms of Japon and
China turns thither much [missionary] effort<a class="noteref" id=

Espa&ntilde;a, since these kingdoms are so magnificent, and summons
many noble spirits, that is not the only conversion; nor ought the
others to be despised where the Lord more quietly (and perhaps in a
humbler way) works marvelous effects among the heathen who are
converted&mdash;and also among the ministers, who profit greatly by so
noble a work. Many examples of this have been written in this history,
which are confirmed by the events of this year among the Indians called
Mandayas, who inhabit some remote and craggy mountains in the province
of Nueva Segovia. Though this island of Lu&ccedil;on is the first which
received the faith in these regions, having done so at the time when
the Spaniards invaded it, there are still many regions in it where for
lack of ministers the faith has not been preached, and where the
inhabitants have never heard more of the gospel than if Christians had
never come hither. This is true not only of a village here and there,
but of whole provinces, each inhabited by its own race and each
possessing its own language, though they are all within this great
island. Such were these Mandayas Indians, the conversion of whom was
begun in this year by father Fray Geronimo de Zamora, a native of
Zarago&ccedil;a, a son of the most religious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>province of Aragon&mdash;from whose report, and
from that of two other fathers who for some time accompanied him, the
following facts are drawn. In the provincial chapter of the year 1631
obedience sent this father as superior to the villages of Fotol and
Capinatan, which are in Nueva Segovia near the aforesaid mountains. He
had great joy in going there, for he immediately entertained great
hopes of the conversion of these Mandaya tribes. They were as
completely given over to their errors as if there had never been a
preacher of the faith in this country, for they lived in mountains
which were very rugged, although they were near the villages above
mentioned. When father Fray Geronimo came thither and saw that these
heathen sometimes came down for trade with the villages, he began to
show them kindness, and to give them some trifles that they thought
much of, until at last he secured their good will. For the time he did
not speak of anything else, for they were not inclined to matters of
the faith, much less to accept ministers who would interfere with the
vices in which they lived and had been brought up. In this way a year
passed, and at the beginning of the next year, seeing that they were
more kindly disposed to him, it seemed to him that he could trust them;
and he determined to go up to their villages. He was confident that
even though they would not admit him as a teacher and preacher, they
would receive him kindly as their friend and benefactor, who was not
coming to take or to ask for what they possessed, but merely to provide
them with a good which they were without. That he might not make a
mistake by following his own opinion, he consulted first with the
father vicar-provincial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href=
"#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>of that region and some grave
fathers of it; and after they had conferred, and discussed the case,
they resolved that father Fray Geronimo should make the journey, while
the others should pray to the Lord for a good result. Hereupon he most
courageously went up into the mountains, about the end of January,
taking with him some Indians whom he could trust and who were of good
intelligence&mdash;acquaintances and friends of the Mandayas. It took
him a day and a half of most laborious traveling to reach their first
village, for they had to row up stream against the current, which is
always strong and in some places terrible. The river runs between high
mountains on both sides and in the middle of the stream there are great
rocks, which make it very dangerous to go up&mdash;and still more so to
go down, because the rapid current carries the boat against the rocks.
They received him with great pleasure, and lodged him in one of their
best houses, though it was built of thatch, after the custom of the
country. Next to it the father had a building erected where he could
say mass; and he sent round to the chiefs of the other villages to ask
them to come to that one, and there he waited for them. They did so
readily, because of their good will toward him; and, when they were all
together, the father&mdash;standing in the midst of them in an open
place, like St. Paul in Athens&mdash;expounded to them the mysteries of
our faith, demolishing the delusions of their errors and the teaching
of the devil, the Father of Lies, and saying much that was suitable for
both purposes. To this they listened with attention, although the
doctrine was new to their ears. God enlightened them within, and hence
they did not answer as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href=
"#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>Athenians did to St.
Paul&mdash;some making a jest of it, and others saying that they would
hear him another time as to this matter, while there were few that
believed; but here all said at once that they believed what they were
taught, and wished to receive this holy law, placing themselves in his
hands to be disposed of as he thought best. Great was the joy which
father Fray Geronimo felt at this answer, which was beyond his hopes;
and he gave many thanks to the Lord, seeing that it was he who had
accomplished the matter so well, so quickly, and with so little effort,
though it was a great matter. He also thanked them, and confirmed them
as much as he could in their good purpose; and he asked them as a proof
of the validity of the promise which they had given him, to grant him,
as sureties that they would not retract it, their infant sons in
baptism. Without hesitation ten of their chiefs on the following day
brought ten infants, their sons, whom father Fray Geronimo immediately
baptized, offering them to God as the first-fruits of this new
conversion. As a token that in the name of Christ our Lord and of his
most holy Mother he assumed possession thereof, he said mass, and
assigned to the village as their patron the Virgin of the Pillar of
Zarago&ccedil;a.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1709src" href="#xd21e1709"
name="xd21e1709src">56</a> It was surely a prudent thought to fasten
this tender church to this strong pillar, upon which from of old that
noble city has been supported, and has stood firm without being
overthrown by the storms that have assailed it since <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>its
foundation, though it be as many years in age as the days of the same
Virgin in this mortal life; and it shall last to the end of the world.
Throughout that whole day the father spent his time in converse with
his new sons, encouraging them to go on with what they had so happily
begun; but he was obliged to leave them for the time, that he might
return to the villages under his care, for Lent was at hand and it was
necessary for him to listen to confessions. The ministers are so few
that their strength and power cannot reach as far as their desire. The
Indians were greatly grieved when they saw that they were to be without
a guide just as they were beginning a path which they had never trod;
but the father was more grieved at being obliged to leave them. He
promised to come back and live among them as soon as he could; and they
determined to go to his superior to beg for a minister and a teacher to
instruct them in the way of salvation. They carried out their plan at
such a fortunate time that they found the fathers preparing to go to
the provincial chapter, which was at hand. The religious promised to
help the Indians in their good purpose, and did so, as will soon be
seen. Father Fray Geronimo departed from them with many tears on both
sides&mdash;the Indians weeping from sorrow at being left behind; the
father partly from grief at leaving them, and partly from joy at seeing
his desires realized and his labors so well begun, for this meant that
the work was half done. The fathers of the chapter complied with the
promise that had been given, and recounted to the definitors the good
beginning of this conversion which they had seen, and the great desire
with which these heathen Indians asked for ministers to teach
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>and baptize them. The result was that the
definitors felt obliged to grant so just a petition, and to give them
as minister and preacher the same Fray Geronimo de Zamora, who offered
to dwell in those solitary mountains in order to carry on what the Lord
had begun through his ministry and diligence. That he might be able to
go, he was provided with two good companions&mdash;a great number where
the religious were so few, and where there was so much calling upon
them for their help. The convent and convents which might be
established there were accepted; and the patronage of the Virgin of the
Pillar was extended over all the Christian churches which might be
formed there. This last request was so just that it brought its
favorable answer with it; and, even if father Fray Geronimo had not
presented it, there was a definitor in that chapter who would have made
it, because he was likewise a native of the same city of
Zarago&ccedil;a, and a son of the famous convent of preachers of that
city. His name was Fray Carlos Clemente Gant,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1717src" href="#xd21e1717" name="xd21e1717src">57</a> long an
excellent minister of the province of Nueva Segovia. It is well that
the sons of that noble city never cease, wherever they are, to see
within their souls that great sanctuary which the city enjoys and in
the shade of which they were bred. Though father Fray Geronimo was
eager to carry out the orders of the chapter, he was unable to do so
until the beginning of September, on account of the obstacles placed in
his way by the devil, who saw how much he was to lose by the
expedition. He finally embarked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232"
href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>to go up the river with one
of his companions, father Fray Luis de O&ntilde;ate,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1722src" href="#xd21e1722" name="xd21e1722src">58</a> who
called himself here by the name of del Rosario; he was a native of
Sevilla, and a son of the convent of Portaceli in the same city, a
religious of much virtue though of few years, and therefore very well
suited to such enterprises. All of his qualifications were necessary,
because in the midst of that voyage, at one most dangerous passage,
full of great rocks, where the waves are high and the current is
stronger, they were unable for three days to make a yard of headway by
the greatest efforts that they could put forth, such was the force of
the current&mdash;or of the devil, who, being unable to do more, strove
in this way to interfere with the fathers on their journey. At last by
patience and perseverance, which conquer everything, they reached the
end of their difficulty. They arrived in the first village of the
Mandayas on September 7, the eve of the Nativity of our Lady&mdash;a
feast which, among the other feasts of the Virgin, is celebrated in
Zarago&ccedil;a with the greatest solemnity by the chapter and the
clergy of the holy church of the Pillar. The Indians received them with
great demonstrations of joy, after their fashion; and with much greater
joy, though a spiritual one, the fathers celebrated on the following
day the birth of the Virgin&mdash;for it seemed to them wonderfully
appropriate to begin the foundation of this conversion on this
day&mdash;the Virgin herself adopting it, so that, as if it were her
own, she might look upon it with the eyes of a mother, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>and
of one so tender. The material (that is, the minds of the listeners)
being so well disposed, it was an easy thing for the word of God to
kindle in it; for it is like fire, as St. Jerome says in his comment
upon the prophet Abdias [<i>i.e.</i>, Obadiah], which consumes the
straw and purifies the grain for the Lord. Hence the first thing which
father Fray Geronimo did, because of his deep spiritual insight and his
great experience as a minister, was to get at them under the straw of
their vices and superstitions, and to place before them immediately the
pure grain and clean seed of the faith. He began, as St. Paul did, in
the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, with the knowledge
of and belief in one sole God, the great reward which He has prepared
for those who serve Him, and the dreadful punishment with which He
chastises the unbelief of the heathen and the sins of those who offend
Him. With such force did he explain the greatness of the reward of
glory, and the horrors of eternal punishment decreed for the heathen,
that all those who heard desired to be baptized immediately. But as
this was not possible for the adults, who must first be instructed in
the matters of our holy faith, and relieved and unburdened from their
previous sins and superstitions, they immediately offered their infant
children, who might receive holy baptism without these preparations.
Within a few days were baptized some three hundred and more, who
learned the whole of the Christian doctrine with strange quickness, a
clear indication of the great willingness with which they were
converted to their Creator. On the first Sunday in October, which came
very soon, an Indian chief and his wife were baptized; and four days
later his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>brother, a youth. It was attributed to the
particular favor of the Virgin of the Rosary, whose festival is
celebrated on that Sunday, that so barbarous a race, without knowing
how to read or write, and bred in those mountains without commerce or
communication even with other Indians, should so quickly learn so many
prayers. This is still more wonderful because they were not taught them
in their own language, which is a savage one, but in that of more
highly civilized Indians, which is quite different from theirs.
Although they usually all understand this latter, they never speak it
among themselves, which increased the difficulty of this matter, and
the grace shown by enabling them to conquer it in so short a time. The
religious went on to two other villages higher up, and were received by
the Indians with the same welcome and signs of rejoicing as in the
first village. These Indians listened as readily to the teaching of the
faith as the others. Here was founded a tiny church under the advocacy
of St. Antoninus&mdash;for when lots were cast for this glorious saint,
St. Jerome, and St. Francis, that of our holy archbishop came out; and,
mass being said in his honor, the church was dedicated to him. Then
followed the baptism of many children, whose fathers readily brought
them for the purpose&mdash;and indeed desired to be the companions of
their children in baptism, but were obliged to wait until they could be
prepared. The religious could not remain here, and wait until they had
prepared them, because they were called back by their obligations to
minister to those who were already Christians in the older villages of
their district, to whom a single religious could not attend
sufficiently. As only one had been left behind, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>the
fathers were obliged to leave them after making so good a beginning,
promising to return afterward and to perfect them in Christianity,
after fulfilling these duties. It may perhaps seem to some a cause for
offense when they shall read that these fathers left this growing grain
in the blade, without protection or anyone to care for it, when there
was danger that the enemy might come and sow tares in the field; but if
the reader will consider how few ministers the province had, and how
much they had to attend to, he cannot fail to see that they did not
only what they could, but many times more&mdash;God giving them courage
for that to which their natural strength, as it seemed, could not
attain. Yet, even so, they were sometimes compelled guiltlessly to fail
in that to which charity would have obliged them if they had been able
to do it.</p>
<p>[When the fathers informed the Mandayas of their intention, the
Indians were so much grieved that the chiefs and the council resolved
to keep the fathers by force if they would not remain with them
willingly. Father Fray Geronimo called their attention to the fact
that, as a good father, he must attend to all his sons alike. They
replied that it would be enough for one to return, and the companion of
father Fray Geronimo was accordingly left behind. He was but new in the
ministry, and was now to be left alone in the midst of these mountains
to cope with the difficulties of a new conversion. Father Fray Geronimo
separated from him and the Indians with little less grief and tears, on
both sides, than when St. Paul departed from the inhabitants of
Ephesus. Father Fray Luis, the minister who remained behind, determined
to guide himself by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href=
"#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>instructions and the example of
father Fray Geronimo. From father Fray Luis is obtained the report
which follows. As it deals with matters in which he was himself
concerned, it was very short, and he was greatly opposed to publishing
it; but the truth of history requires us not to pass over the glory of
his works. He was not to baptize any adults, however well instructed,
until father Fray Geronimo returned, for fear of meeting with the
impediments which are so frequent in such cases&mdash;irregularities in
marriage, or the guilt of unjust enslavements and of wrongs done by the
more powerful to the weaker, or any of a thousand other impediments
which only those who are skilful and experienced in the ministry of new
conversions can detect and settle. Father Fray Luis continued to
exercise his office, and found in the Indians a wonderful hunger and
thirst for the matters of the faith, and great readiness in learning
it. Some Christians who were older in the faith, who had accompanied
the fathers, were astonished. One of these was Don Francisco Tuliao, at
present master-of-camp for the Indians of the whole province of Nueva
Segovia; he had accompanied the religious, and his influence was of
great importance in achieving the conversion of these people. When he
saw the fervor of the Mandayas, and the ease with which they learned
Christianity, though they were regarded even by the other Indians as
rude and barbarous, he declared that the hand of God could be seen in
this work. The Lord took to himself the tithe of the first ten baptized
children; but the Indians who in their heathen days had been accustomed
to spend a week in weeping and mourning their dead children, with a
thousand superstitions and extravagances, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb237" href="#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>before burying them,
now accepted readily from the hand of the Lord the death of baptized
children who departed in their innocence; and, without a sign of grief,
they themselves took the little bodies of their children to be buried
in the church. In the case of adults also, some of them showed
marvelous devotion and were baptized on their deathbeds. Even those who
were not baptized believed, and helped the baptized to die blessedly.
Many signs of true conversion were shown by these Indians; the Virgin
showed special grace to some of the converts, in particular assisting
one poor woman of small intelligence to learn the prayers, with which
she had great difficulty; and miracles were wrought in order that those
predestined by God might not die unbaptized. By the twelfth of January
of the following year more than five hundred of this tribe had been
baptized; and though it would seem that such a number would have
justified the permanent residence of a minister among them, father Fray
Luis was obliged to leave the Mandayas, to go to aid in hearing the
confessions of those in the lower villages, where there were only six
confessors for more than eight thousand penitents. He departed from
them with grief, and left behind for their instruction some Indians
qualified for the purpose, among them the master-of-camp Don Francisco
Tuliao (who was an Indian). He had accompanied the religious in their
good work, being also directed by the civil authorities to lead in a
war for the reduction of some Indians near the Mandayas, in villages
called Ysson.] They had risen; and, being favored by their location in
the midst of rugged mountains, had refused the obedience and the
tributes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>which they had been accustomed to pay to their
encomenderos. This difficulty was happily settled by Don Francisco, as
a result of his prudence and authority. The truth is that the thing was
already practically settled, father Fray Geronimo de Zamora having
arranged it when he came up for the first time to the Mandayas. At this
time he summoned the chiefs of the villages of Ysson along with the
rest; and the arguments of this father had such an influence upon them
that they immediately yielded to them and put themselves in his hands.
As a token of their fidelity they cut off their hair, which is much
cherished by these heathen; and this was as much as to say that they
renounced their ancient customs and the laws of their ancestors, and
that they desired to embrace the law of God, whose servants did not
wear their hair long, as did all the heathen. Would that there had been
ministers and preachers to give them; for they would have been able to
enter this region immediately, and to go among the heathen villages,
baptizing the Indians as if they had never served the devil. It is a
pity that many of them should be still completely given up to their
errors, for lack of someone to declare the truth to them. As soon as
father Fray Geronimo and his companion were able to leave the
confessions and the communion of the elder Christians, they returned to
the aid of these new ones who so greatly required their presence. It
did not seem that their absence had caused any great evils, for they
found them well taught and prepared for baptism. Accordingly, a few
days afterward, on one of the feasts of the Virgin, namely, the
Purification, they were able to baptize eighty-three persons who had
come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>to years of discretion, belonging to the leading
families in that country; and in two days more, forty others, elderly
men. They took as great pains as they could to keep these solemn
baptisms for festivals of our Lady, in recognition of her patronage,
and with the purpose that after their spiritual birth these tribes
might remain very devoted to her and continue under her protection.
Music to make these baptisms joyful there was not in these villages,
because they were so new; but there was no lack of music in heaven, for
if the conversion of one sinner causes rejoicing there, the conversion
of so many heathen could not fail to cause great joy indeed.</p>
<p>In the following April, father Fray Geronimo de Zamora reported that
the conversion of the Mandayas was advancing; and that their Christian
character was, by the grace of our Lady of the Pillar, becoming better
and better established. These Mandayas Indians were little esteemed in
the province of Nueva Segovia, being regarded as fickle and inconstant,
and of small capacity&mdash;so that some venerable and prudent
ministers thought it was not wise to extend Christianity so rapidly
among them. But the proofs which they gave of being aided by heaven
relieved their ministers of these fears, and caused them to baptize
them without delay. They learn the faith rapidly, readily give up their
old superstitions, and are much devoted to prayer. Before baptism they
paid their debts, gave liberty to their slaves who were unjustly held,
and did many other things that are very hard. They have given up
killing and wronging their neighbors, and are now so friendly and
peaceful that they visit and entertain each other without
suspicion&mdash;even in the case of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>persons, who a short
time ago, were hunting each other with the purpose of committing
murder. Under all these circumstances, was there any reason for
prohibiting their baptism?</p>

Japon.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Father Fray Thomas de Sant Jacintho was a native of
Firando in Japon, and was the son of Christian parents. He learned
Latin and began ecclesiastical studies, and even commenced to preach,
under the direction of the fathers of the Society. The breaking-out of
the persecution obliged him to go to Manila to carry out his studies;
so that he pursued the study of theology under the religious of St.
Dominic in that city, where he assumed the habit. He showed great
keenness of mind, and advanced far in learning. He was a companion of
father Fray Jacobo de Sancta Maria, whose glorious martyrdom has been
described. The native pride and hauntiness of the Japanese are very
much opposed to the religious state, but father Fray Thomas in his
novitiate and throughout his life exhibited the greatest humility. He
spoke Spanish like a native, and took delight in fulfilling the duties
and performing the offices of a friar. He made his profession August
16, 1635, being thirty-five years of age, and continued to carry on the
study of theology afterward. Under these circumstances he was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>selected by the father provincial, Fray
Bartholome Martinez, as one of those to go to the island of Hermosa. On
the way, the expedition was detained for some months in the province of
Nueva Segovia, the climate of which is well known to be most adverse
for the Japanese, who generally fall sick and die there. This had
happened only a short time before to two priests, companions of his and
devout religious. Father Fray Thomas, however, said nothing of his
fears, and the Lord preserved him for the acceptable sacrifice which he
was to make in Japon. There was great difficulty in sending religious
to Japon; out father Fray Thomas went, disguised in Japanese dress, to
the island of the Lequios, which is subject to the Japanese. Here by
the death of his companion he was left alone, with ornaments and money,
and with the direction to go to Japon at the first opportunity and to
present himself to his superior, at that time the holy martyr Fray
Domingo de Erquicia. In the letter which father Fray Thomas wrote back,
he briefly mentions being in the island of the Lequios, making no
allusion to the great sufferings which he must have passed through on
this journey. He reached Japon in the year 1630, remaining there to the
end of the year 1634, four years in all. He was a great help and
comfort to the afflicted Christians. The authorities sought after him
with great diligence, offering large rewards for his capture, and
displaying the greatest severity against those who harbored the
ministers of the faith.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href=

<p class="first">[Father Fray Jordan de San Estevan was a Sicilian, who
had assumed the habit of our order in his native country. Hearing of
the crowns of martyrdom which had been attained in Japon, he went to
Espa&ntilde;a, hoping that he might make his way thence to this
province and have the opportunity of offering his life for Christ. He
carried on his studies in the convent of our order in the city of
Truxillo, and was a religious of the utmost devotion, abstinence, and
spiritual elevation. Submitting his purposes to persons of learning and
virtue, he received their approval, and set out for these islands. He
formed a most intimate friendship with father Fray Jacintho de
Esquivel, or del Rosario, who afterward was a holy martyr. To pass his
time when in Mexico&mdash;for he was a great enemy of idleness&mdash;he
wrote an elegant Latin summary of the lives of the saints of our order.
When he reached these islands he postponed to his obedience his
eagerness to go to Japon; and was assigned to minister to the Chinese,
whose language and letters he learned, being acquainted with many
thousand characters. The Lord had given him a great gift of languages;
for in addition to his native language he knew Latin, Greek, Spanish,
Chinese, that of the Indians of Nueva Segovia, and finally the
Japanese. He generally lived in the hospitals of the Chinese, obeying
the whims of the sick Chinese with the greatest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=

permission to go to Japon, passing for a Chinese. In 1632 he set sail,

wandered about through the mountains. As a result of exposure he was
afflicted by a severe illness, but was cured by the grace of God.]</p>

extraordinary diligence for an Augustinian father named Miguel, a
Japanese by nation. The inquisition brought the officers of the law to
the house where fathers Fray Jordan and Fray Thomas were lodging; and
though, being informed of its approach, they fled, they were caught on
the day of our father St. Dominic, August 4, 1634. When examined in
court they answered briefly and boldly, and with Christian liberty
showed no reverence to their unjust judges, denying the accusation of
being spies of Espa&ntilde;a. After a severe imprisonment and being
ignominiously treated by the judges, before whom they were called
several times, they suffered from the dreadful torture of water, which
was poured down their throats until they swelled out like bags. They
were then laid on the ground and a plank placed upon them, with two men
on it, who trod on the plank and thus forced the water out of their
mouths, ears, nostrils, eyes and other parts, with such torture as may
be imagined. Afterward they again <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244"

forced it out again. They were subject to other tortures of the most
horrible nature. November 11, 1634, sixty-nine persons, men and women,
were taken out of prison to suffer for Christ, some by burning, some by
beheading, and our glorious martyrs by being suspended head downward.
As they passed through the streets, the Christians showed them secret
signs of respect. The martyrs who declared their faith were brought to
a place of execution. Father Fray Jordan lingered for seven days, and
father Fray Thomas somewhat less. During his lifetime father Fray
Jordan had received marked signs of the divine favor, having power to
reveal their secrets to guilty hearts, and receiving other special

a Christian, and with protecting the religious. They revived in her

<p class="first">[Though the religious of our order who had recently
entered Great China had not enjoyed entire freedom from disturbance,
they had met with no such opposition as they had expected. They
baptized many who became devout Christians. The Christians converted in
China are better Christians than those converted in these islands,
being of higher rank and greater intelligence. They live a life of
devotion, and do much penance. They often ask acute questions, which
cause the minister difficulty in answering; and they are very constant
in times of persecution. Up to this year 1634 our province has had in
China only two priests; while the Order of St. Francis has sent two
others, who have at our request labored in company with the members of
our order. Our religious have gone to cities which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span>do
not belong to any other order, in order to avoid collisions. The
Chinese women are kept in such seclusion that their conversion has been
very difficult, though their husbands sometimes bring them; and the
Lord has in some remarkable cases shown special favor to the preaching
of his gospel by the members of our order. The Lord also works miracles
by the hands of His preachers, showing that He is the true God, and
that the idols are vanity. In especial, He has cast out devils by His
ministers. At times the Chinese heathen have risen against the
Christians, and have spread false tales about them. Three such
uprisings are described, the church being torn down in one of them,
some Christians being maltreated, and a few being slain. The judge
punished the rioters, but directed the religious to leave the city. The
women are devoted Christians. Father Fray Juan Baptista de

the Chinese rioters, and a number of weak Christians fell away; but
even under these circumstances the presence of the missionaries
achieved much. The Chinese are great idolaters, especially the women,
for they believe that after death they shall come to life again in new
form, even men taking the form of brute animals, and good women
becoming men&mdash;which is something which they regard highly, because
of the subjection and inferiority of women in China. The Chinese in the
region where the fathers were at work were given to horrible vices and
to excessive and superfluous courtesy. The converted Chinese departed
from their vices, and did much penance.]</p>

illumination. The superiors of the religious orders went secretly to
behold the mode in which the ancestors were worshiped, of which a full
description is given in the text. The magistrates are required to
render special worship to an idol named Chinhuan, the Christian
magistrates, in order to hold their office, being obliged to perform
sacrifices to this idol. Among the flowers they conceal a small cross,
thus thinking that they may be able to satisfy their consciences and to
keep their offices. All the Chinese scholars are obliged to sacrifice
to Conchu. This worship is required of the mandarins and all public
officers. Our religious informed the Christian Chinese that the mere
exterior performance of these rites was a mortal sin, incapacitating
them to receive the sacrament. It is affirmed by the Chinese that the
fathers of the Society of Jesus permitted them to render this
sacrifice, but this is not the case. The religious, by opposing these
superstitions, met with many difficulties. At this time books were
printed in Chinese against our faith, and the superiors of the two
orders went to visit the author of the books, who, angry at the
correction of the fathers, declared that they had attempted to kill
him. Worse books were issued, one of them by a magistrate. The fathers
openly opposed what was said, and were in danger of death, but were
delivered by the hand of God.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249"

<h3 class="main">The life of father Fray Luis Muro, and his martyrdom
at the hands of heathen Indians in the island of Hermosa.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[To the judgment of flesh and blood it would not seem
that the success of our order in the island of Hermosa was worthy of
our efforts. We have sent there some of our best religious; and they
have converted very few of the Indians, in proportion to the number of
noble religious who have been lost there. Yet to him who will judge
aright, and who understands the worth of the soul, it will not seem
much to have spent the blood of martyrs and the sufferings of holy
religious for the sake of those souls which have passed from this
island to heaven. Among the martyrs on the island a high place is taken
by father Fray Luis Muro, who died gloriously at this time by the hands
of these Indians. He assumed the habit of the order in the famous
convent of San Pablo at Valladolid, where he professed. Feeling the
great need of preachers of the gospel in this province, he left all
that he had to come to these islands (in 1626). He was desirous to go
to Japan, but the Lord, not granting him that, permitted him to attain
martyrdom in another way. He was a most devoted and successful minister
in Bataan, whence he was sent to the island of Hermosa. Here he strove
to bring back to the church those who had martyred father Fray
Francisco de Sancto Domingo, and he obtained their pardon and
safe-conduct. At this time there was a great lack of provisions in the
chief town of the island, because of the failure of the ship
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span>sent with provisions from Manila. Troops were
sent out with money and cloths (which the Indians prefer) to buy
provisions justly, and without inflicting wrong. Father Fray Luis
accompanied the troops, to restrain them from harming the Indians, and
especially from driving back those whom he was striving to regain for
the church. God was pleased that six Chinese vessels laden with rice
should arrive at the time, thus relieving their needs. A small guard,
with whom father Fray Luis remained, was put in charge of the rice, the
rest of the company returning with as much as could be taken at one
time to the chief camp. Father Fray Luis went out to make an attempt to
reconcile some other Indians who had risen against the Spaniards. The
Indians, seeing the Spaniards very few in number, conspired to attack
them. A detachment of troops were attacked in an ambush, and one of the
first who was shot by an arrow was father Fray Luis. The Indians cut
off his head, his feet, and his hands, and washed them with his own
blood. Miracles were wrought upon the holy body, and the provincial
chapter gave special attention to his happy death and his excellent
life.]</p>
<p>This was the last life written in this history by the venerable lord
bishop Don Fray Diego Aduarte. He was taken away by death at the
conclusion of it, that it might not be printed without the life of its
author, and that his memory might be eternal&mdash;not only as a result
of the labor which he spent upon it, but also of the many labors which
he undertook for the Lord and the good of souls, so greatly to the
honor of this province. Some of these have been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=
"pb251">251</a>]</span>recounted in the course of this his book; but
many have remained in silence because they took place in Espa&ntilde;a
where he dwelt many years, filling with great distinction the post of
procurator general of this province. Of what we have seen and known
here, something will now be said, a great tribulation which came upon
this province at this time, and which was in no small degree
contributory to his death, being first dealt with.</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter LVI</h3>
<h3 class="main">A new congregation of religious which was proposed in
these islands at this time</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the ships which reached these islands in this year
1635 there came twenty religious, sent by his Majesty at the request of
the procurator then at the court, father Fray Matheo de la
Villa.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1845src" href="#xd21e1845" name=
"xd21e1845src">62</a> This father had for many years filled that office
with great excellence, because of the great love which he always had
for the province&mdash;in which he had been many years a devoted
minister of the gospel, prior of the principal convent in this city,
and definitor in its provincial chapters. This was the only office
which the province could give him, though it was far below his deserts.
His merits attracted so much attention in the court that, without his
having any idea of it, as the event showed, his Majesty nominated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>him as bishop of Nueva Segovia. The humble
father never accepted the appointment, although strongly urged to do
so; and thus his virtue was better known, and received the higher
glory. When these religious were about to come to this province it
seemed, to one who had been in it and who was then resident at
court,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1853src" href="#xd21e1853" name=
"xd21e1853src">63</a> that this was a good opportunity to put into
execution a certain purpose which he had; and he so disposed matters
that father Fray Matheo de Villa accepted this religious as vicar of
the shipload of twenty ministers sent by his Majesty to the province.
This religious seemed to father Fray Matheo to be a person who would
fill the office excellently, as he had been in these regions. He did
not imagine that in the fair words which he heard was concealed the
deceit which he afterwards learned. The fact was that this religious,
perhaps with a good intention, had for many years striven to divide
this little province, by dismembering from it Japon, China, and the
other heathen kingdoms in which it had new conversions, not considering
that these could not be kept in existence apart from the conversion
which the province maintains here. He had discussed this matter with
our late general, the most reverend father Fray Seraphino Sicco, of
Pavia&mdash;who having governed the whole order with much prudence for
many years, thoroughly knew and understood what would be for its
advantage; and who therefore immediately perceived how destructive to
the province and how harmful to the order this division would be, and
imposed perpetual silence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href=
"#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>upon him with regard to the
matter. For other reasons added to this, he took from him his authority
as procurator of this province and commanded him to have no more to do
with matters of the Indias. Because of this mandate, and for other
reasons concurrent with it, the royal Council of the Indias commanded
him not to go to them. On these accounts he gave over his purpose for
the time being, until the election of a new general of our order, to
whom he went. As he was new in the government and very zealous for the
conversion of the heathen, the religious was able, by making great
offers in that regard, to persuade the father-general to make the
aforesaid division; and to take from the province the said conversions,
and to give them to a new congregation of fathers established for the
purpose. The said father was appointed vicar-general of this
congregation, and for its beginning and support it received all the
houses belonging to this province for which the new vicar proffered his
request. These, excluding the convent of the city of Manila, were the
best in the province. All this was done because of the contention that
this province, being much occupied with the conversions of Indians
which it has undertaken in these Philippinas Islands, could not attend
to the conversions of the said heathen regions. On a bosom so pious and
so desirous for the good of souls as that of the most reverend general
of the order, this made so great an impression that without knowing
anything of the province, not even the procurator that it had in
Espa&ntilde;a, he granted everything that was asked. The suitor knew
very well that this division could not be made without the consent of
our lord the king as patron (in which relation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>he
stands to all the religious orders in the Indias); so he tried all
expedients at court to obtain this assent, but was not successful in
any of his efforts. The prudent counselors of his Majesty, with whom in
particular he discussed the matter, declared that the royal Council
would by no means consent to so great an innovation without first being
informed by the prominent personages of this region with regard to the
advantage or disadvantage of the plan proposed. This caused him to
despair of attaining any of his desires by this road; for he had no
hope that any person acquainted with the facts would declare in favor
of his purposes, because of their thorough impracticability. He
therefore determined to obtain by artifice what he could not obtain by
reason or justice. An opportunity being afterwards offered for
religious to come to this province, he strove to go as their superior,
carefully hiding his purpose from the procurator of this province.
Then, just as they were about to embark from Sevilla, he sent to the
court notice of a mandate and act of excommunication from our most
reverend general, commanding that this new congregation should not be
interfered with on any pretext or cause. This was done at a time when
it was impossible to put any obstacles in his way, because he would
already have embarked beforehand. After leaving Sevilla, and even
before going there, he already had on his side some of the religious,
to whom he had declared his purpose. While at sea he revealed his plan
to all, thus endeavoring to draw them into agreement with him. He
placed before them the opportunity of being taken directly to Japon and
to Great China, a most efficacious bait for the fervor with which the
new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>religious set out from Espa&ntilde;a to the
conversions of those regions. At the same time he strove to disgust
them with the ministries to the Indians, declaring that the province
had now no other ministries, and that he was the only one who could now
send them to those kingdoms and to the conversion of those heathen
regions. In this way he alienated them from the province, to which it
was his duty to take them; for it was for that province that our lord
the king had given them and paid their expenses, and to which our most
reverend general had granted them. He reached the province, and
presented only the letters-patent dividing the province and
establishing the congregation, which were couched in very strong terms.
The provincial, who had already been advised of the whole matter and of
what he ought to reply, listened to them and made the following
response. He was ready to obey the letters and the mandate of the most
reverend general, as his higher officer and lawful superior, when and
in the manner in which his Reverence desired that they should be obeyed
and put into execution. This was by asking and first obtaining the
consent of our lord the king, as patron of all the orders in all the
Indias. Without this consent the division proposed could not be made,
and new provinces and congregations could not be established; and our
most reverend general would not desire to contravene the right and
patronage of the king, because that would be contrary to justice. The
father replied that this matter was now being attended to, and desired
the provincial to show immediate obedience to these letters by
transferring to him the contents of the province which by the letters
were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>assigned to the congregation. This obedience
could not be shown, and therefore his claim was without effect. As
nothing more could be done, the business remained in this condition for
about nine months, during which this father, taking advantage of a
certain opportunity, very inconsistently with his function of
propagating the faith, asked and obtained a force of soldiers, with
which he violently seized by force the houses of this province which he
claimed, contrary to the royal patronage and the will of the most
reverend father. When the general gave those letters with such
authority as he had a right to claim, he desired first that the consent
due by justice should first be asked of the patron, whom he in no wise
intended to wrong. In addition, there were many other reasons making
everything done in virtue of these letters unjust. They were
notoriously surreptitious, and obtained by false information. It was
manifest that the province, although it attended to the ministry to the
Indians of this country, was not forgetful of the ministry to Japon and
China. On the contrary, it gave so much attention to them that it was
constantly suffering from suits and vexations because the governor, the
Audiencia, and the city, and sometimes even the ecclesiastics, declared
that the province went to excess in that direction. It not only sent
preachers of its own order to those realms, but encouraged and stirred
up the other orders to do the same thing, without shrinking from the
excessive expenses necessary for the purpose. To this end it never
imagined itself poor, though it was so poor that it had not and has not
any income more than what the Lord sends it in alms. Hence the pretext
for establishing the new <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href=
"#pb257" name="pb257">257</a>]</span>congregation was manifestly false;
and the letters were so clearly surreptitious that, in order to prove
that they were so, no other evidence was necessary than the evidence of
the governor himself, of the royal Audiencia, and of the councils which
were often held against the province on account of this. Under these
circumstances, our most reverend general did not desire to have his
letters put into execution until he had received information, as is
expressly laid down (even with reference to the commands of the supreme
pontiff) in the law, chap. <i lang="la">Siquando, de rescriptis</i>,
and chap. <i lang="la">Super litteris, eodem.</i> Much more is this
true if most grave inconveniences would result (as they would) to the
conversions of those realms, which inconveniences our most reverend
father by no means desired to bring about. It was his will that the
execution of his letters should be suspended, as they were suspended,
until information was sent to him with regard to the facts; and it was
his will that his determination as superior should be awaited with
humility. Further, in conformity with our constitution (distinction 2,
chap. 1), no religious house may pass from one province to another
unless the transference be approved in three chapters-general; and
hence this great number of houses and of conversions was not to be
immediately transferred at the first direction to that effect, without
further approbation&mdash;especially since the evils which would have
followed from this change were so many, so grievous, and so certain, as
they were instantly proved to be by experience. It is true that the
most reverend general said in his letters that he proceeded in this
matter with the authority of the supreme pontiff, or of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>Congregation de Propaganda Fide; and this would
be enough for his letters to receive entire authority if they were
against particular persons, and did not include spiritual harms and
evils to the aforesaid conversions. But as they were the destruction of
this province, and would have produced the most grievous mischief in
the conversions, the most reverend general did not desire that his
letters should be executed until he had been advised. There was no
obligation to do this, the commission not coming as is expressly said
that it should come in the chapter <i lang="la">Cum in iure, de officio
et potentia iudicis delegati</i>. This is the common judgment of
doctors, from which may be seen how unreasonable it was to take violent
possession of the aforesaid houses. This and other disturbances which
followed caused great grief throughout this colony, for it was
regretted that by information designed to effect an evil purpose, and
in an improper manner, a province should have been so disquieted which
had continued from its foundation in the greatest harmony, without any
disturbances. The archbishop of Manila and three bishops in this
country, the religious orders, and the city, all wrote to the most
reverend general, testifying as eyewitnesses that the information given
to him was not in conformity with that which was actually known to
occur in point of fact. On the contrary, it was declared that the
province had always shown great care and watchfulness in sending
preachers to Japon, Great China, Camboja, the island of Hermosa, and
other heathen realms near these islands; while the congregation which
it was intended to establish not only could not surpass it in this
matter, but could not even achieve as much, as is shown by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>the
many martyrdoms which the province has experienced in these
conversions. This will always be plain, for by the grace of God they
have not ceased nor are they ceasing, as we shall see even in these
very years. The one who suffered most from the disquiet caused by the
new congregation was the bishop of Nueva Segovia, Don Fray Diego
Aduarte; for he was one who had most complete knowledge of the province
of which he had written the history, and he understood him who now
disquieted it, for he had had acquaintance and dealings with him for
many years, and that intimately. He accordingly came directly from his
bishopric, the capital of which is distant from this city of Manila a
hundred and fifty leguas, and strove with all his might that the evil
done should be undone. Though at the time he could not succeed, it is
to be believed that he brought it about afterward, when he went to be
with the Lord. For, returning in deep sadness to his bishopric, he came
to his death before many days; and after this there were not many
months before the matter was cleared up, and affairs were set upon
their ancient basis, by the return to the province of the houses which
had been taken from it. This was notably to its honor and caused the
most universal rejoicing through the country that had been seen in many
years. The people in the villages where missions were established which
had been taken from the province and given to the congregation, were
particularly delighted, and held public festivals for many days, when,
after having experienced the method in which the congregation carried
on its work, they saw the convents and the ministries returned to the
religious of the province<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href=
"#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>&mdash;whose manner of conducting
their affairs was so much better, that it had caused great grief to the
Chinese and the Indians to be deprived of such teachers and ministers.
Therefore, when the religious returned, those people displayed their
delight by costly public rejoicings, carried on for many days.</p>
<p>When the evil befell the province&mdash;which was on the fourth of
May, the first Sunday in the month, and the day of our great saint
Catharine of Siena in the year 1636&mdash;all the religious of the
province went to beg the favor of their patroness, the Virgin of the
Rosary; and in all the houses of the order her holy litany was recited
every night, in unison, with this purpose. This means was so
efficacious that, contrary to every human hope, matters were settled
and arranged as if by the hands of this great lady; and without any
effort on the part of the province so many things were cleared up, and
put together in its favor that finally, by the aid of one who was not
expected to give aid, the truth was victorious; and the houses returned
to their ancient and legitimate possessors, and the province to its
longed-for quiet, September 6, 1637, after having remained in the power
of the congregation one year and four months. The religious being
grateful for this restitution to the Virgin, from whose generous hands
they had received so great a gift, rendered public thanks to her in all
the convents. In the convent of Manila a feast of an octave was most
solemnly celebrated, this lady being drawn in procession with great
majesty, like a triumphant conqueror. As such she remained all those
days in the midst of the main chapel, with the richest adornments and
the finest of decoration. In this we were aided by those outside of the
order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>to give to this lady our highest thanks,
recognizing her supreme grace, which could have been granted by none
but her powerful hand. The duty of writing with all care to the most
reverend general was not neglected now, as it had not been neglected
before; and a full account and report were sent to him showing how
experience had manifested that the information in virtue of which the
new congregation had been obtained was impossible. After the
congregation had been placed in possession, and was under the
obligation of going to the aid of Japon and China and other kingdoms,
it did not do so; and there was no hope that it would do so, nor even
that it would so much as have religious to maintain the houses which it
had taken from the province. It was not to be expected that his Majesty
would send them from Espa&ntilde;a, and there was no other way or
manner in which they could come. The vain expectation of giving many
habits here was immediately disappointed, for even if they desired to
give these, there was no one to whom they could be given, nor was there
anyone suitable for the purpose. This would have been much more true
if, as had been said to the most reverend general, the habit was to be
given to Indians. This was something unworthy of thought; but it was
actually stated in the very patent, because information to that effect
had been given to the most reverend general, though it is contrary to
the judgment of all those of ability who have been in the Indias, and
contrary to the demonstration of experience ever since there have been
religious orders in these regions. As soon as it saw itself possessed
of the houses, it saw also the great difficulty or impossibility of
this project; and even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href=
"#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>to maintain them it found itself
obliged to disquiet the religious of the province by persuading them to
enter the congregation. Some were even received, contrary to the
express mandate of our most reverend general laid down in this patent
itself. It is plain from this that these proceedings must have been the
cause of great annoyance and of many difficulties, for there was
nothing but lawsuits with the province, and disturbances, which left no
time to pay attention to the greater fruit of the conversions of the
heathen which had been promised. On the contrary, it interfered with
them, as the Lord, who was offended with these acts revealed, however
secret the interference was kept. There must be added to all this that
the congregation, from its very beginning, began to relax and to give
up the supports which the prudent and holy founders of the province set
up in holy manner for the maintenance of the evangelical ministry which
it exercised. These are prayers, the disciplines, the rigorous
abstinence, and the like, commanded by the constitution and ordained in
the same law. The congregation did not accept them; and on this
account, and because of the results which followed, it could not
continue, and was brought to an end, the Lord not permitting that to go
further which set out with so bad a beginning. Even before seeing these
evil results by experience, nearly all the religious brought by this
father from Espa&ntilde;a foresaw them; and, leaving him, they were
nearly all incorporated with the province. Generally speaking, the more
religious and intelligent of them did not desire to go to the
congregation; for they judged with much prudence that a thing which was
so ill founded could not have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263"
href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>a good end, as it did not.
Some of these have obtained the reward of this wise decision, for they
have been sent to the province of Japon, and became most glorious
martyrs, as we shall soon tell. One of those who were appointed for
this most holy and happy mission lost and abandoned it by abandoning
the province and joining the congregation. As a penalty for this act,
he lost the crown of martyrdom, which his companions gained by
remaining in the province. Thus the Lord manifested the truth of what
we said when we declared that the province was more careful and even
more able to attend to these missions than was the congregation which
was formed for them. At the very time when the province sent out this
mission, the congregation regarded it as impossible, and even strove to
impede it, as has been said.</p>

<h3 class="main">The life and death of the venerable bishop Don Fray
Diego Aduarte, a religious of this province</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">For those who knew the great virtues of the most
religious father and most perfect bishop Don Fray Diego Aduarte, this
history must certainly fall under the condemnation of being incomplete,
not only because it passes over in silence the great good which he
wrought in Espa&ntilde;a before coming to this country, but also
because he showed singular dexterity, in hiding, because of his
humility, the admirable works in which he exercised himself, though
when in the province he much surpassed others. In this he was much
aided by his nature, which was not a little taciturn; and although he
corrected this fault <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264"
name="pb264">264</a>]</span>by virtue, and those who dealt with him
intimately found him always most kind, and extremely glad to do good to
all, yet in himself at first sight and in one&rsquo;s first
conversation with him he did not seem so, and did not even give signs
of the great devotion which he concealed within himself. Yet after no
long time he revealed himself to one who had to do with him; and his
devotion was the more admirable and the more esteemed the more it
exceeded his nature and the less it was exhibited. At the same time,
his great care to hide his own good works and his taciturn nature have
concealed from us many deeds and writings of great edification and good
example. He was a native of Zarago&ccedil;a, and was of noble birth. At
the age of sixteen he came to Castilla; and, as he was passing casually
through Alcala de Henares, he fell into conversation with a religious
of the order, who told him how, though he was a student in the college
which the order has there, he was giving up this position, with all the
hopes which it offered him, and was leaving all his kinsmen and friends
in Espa&ntilde;a to go to the Philippinas. The religious said that a
new province was about to be established there, under the strictest
rules, and on a basis of so extensive charity as to strive with all
diligence and care for the conversion of the many heathen regions
there. [This conversation, and certain other reasons, decided the young
Diego to ask for the habit in that convent which the order has in
Alcala; and they very willingly gave him the habit immediately, April
9, the day of St. Peter Martyr in the year 1586. He made his
profession, and, being well instructed in the matters of religion and
virtue, after the custom of the order went to study, reaching high
attainments <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>in scholarship. He was ordained priest in the
year 1594, and returned to Alcala on some business, without thinking of
journeying to these regions. In spite of the incident described, he had
never had any inclination to it, or to any other of the Indias; but was
possessed by a particular love for the quiet and calm caused by
retirement in the cell.] At that time there arrived there one of the
religious who had founded this province in the beginning, Fray Alonso
Delgado; he had returned to Espa&ntilde;a, to assemble companions to
carry on the many conversions of the heathen which had been happily
begun. A few days before, the patents of the general of our order had
been read in this convent, giving him authority to take with him those
who might enlist in so holy a work. Father Fray Francisco Blancas, who
was afterward called here &ldquo;de Sant Joseph,&rdquo; had offered
himself. The prior and the friars of the convent had tried to hinder
him because of the need of him which they should feel; for it seemed to
them that there was scarcely anyone in the province who in life,
spirit, and teaching could fill his place. Father Fray Alonso Delgado
had complained of their interference, and was now returning with new
directions that no one should disturb those who desired to go on this
holy expedition. This brought to an end the force brought to bear by
the prior and the convent, but not their prayers and persuasions that
the said father would remain. Father Fray Francisco Blancas and father
Fray Diego Aduarte were very fond of each other, being natives of the
same kingdom of Aragon, sons of this convent of Alcala, and being
almost of one age and of one mind. [Accordingly the prior asked father
Fray Diego to persuade <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href=
"#pb266" name="pb266">266</a>]</span>father Fray Francisco to remain;
but both of them were induced to go to Filipinas by the arguments of
father Fray Alonso. With great content the two began their journey from
Toledo on the first of June, and reached Sevilla in a fortnight walking
poorly and humbly, and setting a noble example. They caused great joy
in all the companions who, expecting father Fray Francisco alone, saw
him arrive with so good an associate. When they set sail they met with
great hardships. The ship was very inconvenient, being small and having
no quarter-deck. They met with contrary winds and heavy seas the first
fortnight of the voyage, which is the hardest for inexperienced
sailors. They met with the heaviest weather in the gulf well named the
Gulf de las Yeguas (<i>i.e.,</i> &ldquo;of the Mares&rdquo;) because of
the kicks which it generally gives to those who sail through it. On the
land journey, before they reached the City of Mexico four of the
religious fell sick, among them father Fray Diego, who alone escaped.
The rest of the chapter consists of a somewhat abbreviated repetition
of the accounts of journeys already given in the body of the work. A
few details are added. For instance, we are told that, in the prayers
of the fathers, father Fray Diego was usually the one to wake the
others up by beginning the singing of the <i>Te Deum</i>. Those next
him observed that he spent nearly all of the night on his knees in
prayer. The only additional information as to his life in Manila before
the first of his many voyages is, that he was assigned to the ministry
to the Chinese. He learned the language, though he found it very
difficult, hearing confessions and preaching in it within a few months.
The narrative <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>of the first journey to Camboxa is given as in
chapters xlvi&ndash;xlviii of book i, with the addition of some new
information. When the Spaniards left Camboxa they passed by the
contiguous kingdom of Champa, because of the savagery of the
inhabitants, and went on to Cochinchina. The cruelties of the ruler of
this kingdom are described at some length; and we are informed that on
the return voyage the vessel in which father Fray Diego was sailing was
obliged to take refuge in one of his ports. An account is given of a
miracle wrought by the habit of father Fray Diego, which had been left
behind with four soldiers in a boat at the time of the attack on the
king of Camboja. These soldiers were shot at with volleys of arrows
from the shore, but were protected by the holy habit as by a wall. The
great respect felt by the religious of Malaca for father Fray Diego
when they become acquainted with his virtue and learning is
recounted.]</p>

<p class="first">[This chapter contains an account of the unsuccessful
expedition to Camboxa undertaken by Don Luis Perez Das Mari&ntilde;as,
as narrated in book i, chapters xlix and l, of this history. In that
narrative, given by father Fray Diego, he breaks off in the account of
his own experience at the point where he was separated from the rest of
the company, having gone to Macan to be cured of his illness while the
others returned to Manila.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href=
"#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span></p>
<p>He was not able to remain very long in Macan because many Chinese
mandarins frequently came to that city, and to the convent where father
Fray Diego was, since the city is in China itself; and it did not seem
to him that he was safe from the inspector. As there was no opportunity
for him to make a voyage in any other direction, he set out for Malaca,
a city of India about as far from Manila as Macan is. As we shall see,
he went away partly that that ship and all in it might not perish. They
set sail in the middle of January; and as they were crossing from the
gulf of Haynao to the coast of Cochinchina, Champa, and Camboja, there
was a furious storm at the same place where he had met a storm two
years before, and on the same night, between the eighth and ninth of
February. [This stripped the ship of its rigging, and threw them into
great distress; however, as it was strong and steered well, it soon
righted itself and reached Malaca. Here father Fray Diego remained, and
the vessel sailed again for Goa, but came back again after struggling
for forty days with heavy seas and unfavorable winds. Having lost this
opportunity it was obliged to winter there, and departed with the next
monsoon, in the middle of the following December. In it there went
three Portuguese religious of our order, taking with them father Fray
Diego, who, because of his poverty, was not provided with ship-stores.
After they had passed the famous island of Zeilan (<i>i.e.</i>,
Ceylon), and were in latitude six, they encountered so heavy a sea that
they were driven back to the equator, under the lee of the Maldive
Islands, where a ship never lands. Caught in that archipelago of reefs
and atolls, the Portuguese are long delayed before they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>can
make their way out. At last they reach the harbor of Kocchi in India,
&ldquo;after having spent five months in sailing four hundred
leguas;&rdquo; and, if they had arrived a few hours later, could not
have entered the port over the bar, although they emptied the ship.
Father Fray Diego waited in India for the season when he could voyage
to Espa&ntilde;a.] He was not idle, but was occupied with many devout
exercises, which he had continued even when he was at sea. Yet this was
not what he most desired, and not what was most suitable to his wishes,
and to his calling as a religious. Hence when he found himself in
convents of devoted religious, his spirit was greatly rejoiced; and he
strove there to lay up some provision of devotion for the long voyage,
in the service of God and of these new conversions, which he proposed
to undertake to Espa&ntilde;a for preachers. He visited first the
Christians converted by the apostle St. Thomas, whose Christianity has
endured from his time to the present in India, and is now purged from
its errors, which it incurred only for lack of Catholic preachers.
There are in that country matters to arouse great devotion, and anyone
who was so devout as father Fray Diego could not go that way without
visiting them, even at the cost of many days of journey and hardship.
This was not in vain, but brought with it much spiritual reward. He
embarked January 15, 1603, in the &ldquo;San Roque,&rdquo; a very large
ship with four decks and two quarter-decks. They had favorable weather
to the latitude of Cape de Buena Esperan&ccedil;a [<i>i.e.</i>, of Good
Hope]; and thus a long vacation from hardships was provided for father
Fray Diego, who had been inured to suffering them in the service of Him
who was his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name=
"pb270">270</a>]</span>comfort in them. [But here they encountered
first calms, and then fearful tempests, which almost wrecked the ship;
and, to save their lives, they were compelled to lighten the ship,
casting into the sea pepper and rich stuffs valued at fifty thousand
ducados. Finally, they passed the Cape of Good Hope on May 12. The rest
of the voyage was peaceful, save that they encountered a storm off the
coast of Portugal; but they escaped from this and landed at Vigo, which
is in Galicia, September 17, after having passed eight months in
navigation. They all went barefoot to church to give thanks to the
Lord, who had delivered them from so many and such great perils; and
father Fray Diego went to visit the church of the apostle of
Espa&ntilde;a,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1939src" href="#xd21e1939"
name="xd21e1939src">64</a> which is fourteen leguas from there, because
it would not have been proper to miss this devotion on account of so
short a journey.]</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After all these hardships and perils, which were
suffered with such great patience, father Fray Diego went to the court
of Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;not to gain honor or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>wealth, or rent, or any other temporal thing;
but because of love of the Lord, for His glory, the extension of the
gospel, and the salvation of these tribes. Since he had already passed
through so many difficulties, divine Providence did not see fit that he
should find them there, where there are ordinarily so many; and the
royal Council immediately gave him permission and direction to convey a
number of religious to this province at his Majesty&rsquo;s expense,
that they might there carry on the excellent work which had been begun
by <span class="corr" id="xd21e1951" title="Source: he">the</span>
religious of this order, and that they might continue to draw heathen
from the darkness of unbelief to the light of the gospel. Father Fray
Diego was not of a character to regard himself as exhausted, although
he had so many reasons to be so; and therefore, without more delay, he
traversed the [ecclesiastical] provinces of Espa&ntilde;a, Aragon, and
Andalucia, seeking for laborers for this part of the vineyard of the
church, or this new vine in it. [As this was a work of God, He moved
the hearts of many good religious to volunteer to undertake this
arduous enterprise. They were greatly influenced by hearing from father
Fray Diego and others of the great need and lack of religious in this
province, to accomplish the vast work with which it is charged; and of
the good done by our order in these regions, which follows the
primitive order in the strict observance of the rule, and which is like
the primitive church in the conversion of the peoples. This company
embarked near the first of July, 1605; and, after suffering the
ordinary discomforts of two long voyages following so closely one after
the other, they reached Manila the next year, six having died in the
voyages and journeys. One of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>these was father Fray Pedro
Valverde, a student in the college of San Gregorio, a son of San Pablo
at Cordova, and a religious of superior virtue. He died as the vessel
was just beginning to come among the islands, and was buried in an
Indian hamlet near the port of Ybalon. Some years afterward, when the
father provincial sent a religious for his bones, he found the body
still entire, without a foul odor or any decay, just as if it had been
newly buried; but neither the Indians nor their encomendero would
permit him to take it away, keeping possession of it as a holy body.
The day after they arrived, the superior gave them their assignments
throughout all the province because of the great need of religious; and
many were sent to Nueva Segovia.] Ere long, many of the religious wrote
to him thanking him for having brought them to so devoted a province,
where they had so much opportunity to serve God and to do good to their
fellow-men. In particular, father Fray Matheo de la Villa, a son of
Sant Esteban at Salamanca, wrote to him. He was in a large village, the
whole population of which was composed of heathen who desired to become
Christians. He taught them what they desired much, and he desired more.
He wrote that on Holy Saturday he had been obliged to baptize six
hundred of them in a church which they themselves were making; and that
he now understood the language of the natives sufficiently, though he
had been only six months learning it. In spite of this diligence, they
were not able to attend to this great spiritual harvest, for the
laborers were few; and so, though new and old were apportioned, there
were not enough, although they did all in their power, for many
villages of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>heathen who begged for them with great urgency.
The provincial, grieved by this, and seeing that he had no answer to
make except that he would pray God to bring religious from
Espa&ntilde;a, wrote to father Fray Francisco de Sant Joseph, whom he
had left in Manila as vicar-provincial, and to the other religious, an
account of affairs. In particular he told them that the Indian chiefs
from inland had come to him begging him, on their knees and in tears,
to give them a religious to teach them the way to heaven; and that one
of them had offered to make a village of two thousand inhabitants and
the other of nine hundred, in order that the religious might with
greater ease give them Christian instruction. The Indians in their
heathen condition live in farmsteads and tiny hamlets, where it is very
difficult to teach them; and it is impossible that teaching shall
enlighten them, because of the inability of the religious to care for
and attend to so many small villages. Hence, to make good Christians of
them, it is necessary to gather them in larger villages. At the
beginning, there was great difficulty in causing the Indians to leave
their ancient abodes; though by the help of God, and of that spirit of
gentleness and kindness which He gives to His disciples, the religious
overcame it. These heathen Indians were so eager to have teachers that,
unlike the rest, they did not wait to be asked; but, to succeed in
obtaining religious, themselves offered by anticipation to remove this
difficulty, which is generally so great. The provincial wrote, in
addition, that if the ministers at Manila should be reduced somewhat in
number he could send someone, or someone could go, to help in this
extreme need, to which he could not give aid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>from
there. Father Fray Francisco de Sant Joseph called together the fathers
who formed the council; and they, after considering the case, found
only one religious who could go. This was father Fray Jacintho de Sant
Jeronimo. Because of this father Fray Francisco de Sant Joseph&mdash;as
one who always thought of himself that he did little, and that he would
be little missed&mdash;set out with this religious at the time of his
embarcation, without consulting anyone else. In this he acted as
superior, which he then was. After he had sailed eight leguas, he wrote
to the religious of Manila that he was going to supply this lack, since
it seemed to him that he would not be much missed here. But the
father-provincial did not approve, because he knew that for the Indians
about Manila, whose language he understood admirably, he was a St.
Paul. On this account he was called, even by the religious of other
orders, &ldquo;the apostle of the Indians.&rdquo; For the Spaniards he
was a second St. John Chrisostom in preaching and life; and hence the
provincial was not slow in sending him back to his former post.</p>
<p>The position of prior of the principal convent in the province of
Manila was vacant, and the religious in it unanimously elected father
Fray Diego as their superior. He declined the position as long as he
could, and accepted it only when he was compelled to do so by the rule
of strict obedience. He filled the position remarkably well, though he
did not hold it long; for in the following year the vessels from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a brought news of the death of father Fray Domingo de
Nieva, who had gone in the preceding year as procurator of this
province in Espa&ntilde;a. He had left the cares of this life to enjoy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>the quiet which, because of his great virtue and
charity, the Lord had kept for him in heaven. Since it was very
necessary for the province to have someone in Espa&ntilde;a to send
them religious&mdash;for without this supply the province could not be
maintained&mdash;they immediately arranged to send another; and no one
was found so suitable as father Fray Diego. He was accordingly asked to
return and begin his labors anew by embarking for Espa&ntilde;a, where
he was to act as the procurator of this province in all matters, and
was especially to provide them with religious.... Notwithstanding the
hardships and dangers of that voyage, his love to God and the province,
and his perception of the need which forced them to do this, outweighed
these other considerations; and he immediately prepared himself for the
departure which was at hand. With only three woolen tunics in place of
shirts, and the ship-stores for the first voyage, without a real or
anything else for the remainder of the journey, he embarked in the
middle of July, having remained in Manila not quite a full year. They
had good weather until they reached the latitude of Japon, and from
there such furious winds as lifted the sea up to the sky.... Since they
had come from so hot a climate as that of this country, and had so
suddenly entered this other, which was so cold, they could not fail to
suffer from many diseases. Many died on this voyage, among them the
commander and the master of the ship, and a rich merchant who was a
passenger. He, perceiving father Fray Diego&rsquo;s holy way of life,
his great virtue, poverty, contempt for temporal things, devotion
toward God, and charity toward his fellow-men, gave him all his wealth,
which amounted to seventy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href=
"#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>thousand pesos, that he alone, at
his own pleasure, without being obliged to render account to anyone,
might distribute the whole of it in pious works. He told him that,
though he had no heirs to whom he was obliged to leave anything, he had
some poor relatives in Portugal (whence he had come), and he charged
him to aid them. Father Fray Diego gave so much attention to the
fulfilment of his wish that he went in person to Portugal solely for
this purpose, sought with great care for the relatives of the deceased,
relieved their necessities, and left them all in good circumstances,
considering their estate, and very content. He also fulfilled the rest
of the desires of the testator in accordance with the trust given him,
without applying to himself or to any relative of his more than the
trouble and the reward from God, which would not be small. [Father Fray
Diego went on to Espa&ntilde;a, and thence to Francia, that he might
for his province, and personally, yield obedience to the most reverend
general of the order, at that time Fray Agustin Galamino, a holy man,
who as such took particular delight in hearing what father Fray Diego
related as an eyewitness of the devotion of the province of the
Philippinas and of the great services which it wrought for the Lord in
the conversions of these idolatrous tribes. The pious general gave him
all the documents necessary for taking religious thither; and father
Fray Diego was about to return with the documents, that he might not
lose a moment in the execution of his trust, the great importance of
which he perceived. But his superior obliged him to remain for the
general chapter, which was to be held in the middle of the year in
Paris (in which he was a definitor)&mdash;to the great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>regret of father Fray Diego at losing all this
time from the affairs of the province of which he thought so much. For
ten years he filled this office of procurator for the province in
Espa&ntilde;a, setting an admirable example to lay and religious, who
saw him always humble, devout, and in poverty, and putting forward no
claims for himself, either within or without the order. This made him
freely able to express his judgment with holy and religious liberty
before the royal Council and to the president and members of it. They
all looked upon him with special respect. He aided in sending the
religious brought to this province by father Fray Alonso Navarete, who
afterward was a holy martyr, the first one of our order to suffer in
Japon, and the one who opened the door of martyrdom for so many as
afterward followed his good example. He later sent another shipload,
with father Fray Jacintho Calvo; and the same father Fray Diego, after
sending these first two, afterward set out to bring other religious
with him. But, when he arrived in Mexico, he received letters from the
provincial of this province, desiring him to return to Espa&ntilde;a
and continue his functions as procurator-general in it. Here he could
be of use only as one man; there he could do the work of many, by
sending so many good religious. He went back to the labor which he had
desired to give up; and abandoning a life of contemplation in a cell,
for which he was eager, he returned to the publicity of tribunals, and
the distraction of journeys, from which he desired to flee. At all
times, however, he was instant in prayer, and in other devout
exercises. As a reward for this care, he received from the Lord success
in the business which he undertook, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb278" href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>a successful despatch
of it being furthered by his prayer&mdash;which, it seemed, would have
taken off his attention from his business and interfered with it. In
spite of all this experience of the pleasure of the Lord in this
exercise, he still desired to retire and to prepare himself for a holy
death; and he constantly begged the superior of this province to send
him a successor, that he might return to it.]</p>
<p>The province sent father Fray Matheo de la Villa, who has several
times been mentioned with praise. Thereupon father Fray Diego, after
obtaining the necessary licenses and decrees, gathered twenty
companions and came to live and die with them in this
province&mdash;nearly all the members of which were his sons, whom he
had sent or brought from Espa&ntilde;a, as has been recounted. Hence he
was received as the general father of all, and was by all much beloved
for the great good which he had wrought for all of them, for each one
in particular, and for the whole province in general, by means of many
royal decrees and grants which he had obtained at court for medicine
for the sick, wine for the masses, oil for the lamps which burned
before the most holy sacrament, and habits for the religious, which are
great sources of relief in our great poverty. Among these things the
provision for the dress of the religious ought not to be passed over in
silence. Neither the province nor any house within it had any regular
source of income; and it provided for all its expenses entirely with
alms received from the faithful. Since serge for our habits had to be
brought from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, it was a difficult thing for the
province to send every year the money for all the clothing of the
religious, at the price in Mexico. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279"
href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>The province provides the
religious with clothing, for no member of it cares for himself, or has
any deposit or anything else of his own, not even with the permission
of his superior. Hence the province sent directions to father Fray
Diego to ask his Majesty to give as alms the clothing for all the
religious of the province&mdash;and this not for one year or two, but
forever, since the same need and poverty were to continue forever.
Father Fray Diego, who was acquainted with the heavy demands upon the
royal treasury, regarded it as impossible to obtain this; and he put
off asking for it until he felt obliged to send an answer to the
province. Feeling practically certain that it would not be granted, he
asked for it in a memorial of his own, sending in other memorials in
which he asked for things which seemed to him very easy to grant; and
when he looked over the answers he found that the royal Council had
unhesitatingly allowed the grant and gift of the clothing (which he had
regarded as impossible), but had refused everything which he asked for
in the other memorial. From this it was plain that it was God who had
in His hand the heart of the king; and that He had done more than what
human prudence might hope for. This truth was all the more confirmed by
the fact that when the royal decree came to be presented before the
royal officials in Mexico, who were always accustomed to put a thousand
difficulties and contingencies in the way of such grants, they not only
did not put any such in the way of this grant; but, seeing that the
religious had from mere timidity asked much less than they needed,
urged them to ask for a sufficient amount. The matter was immediately
settled on this footing, and has remained so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>ever
since, a plain token that the Lord is pleased that the religious of
this province shall wear the habits which they have always
worn&mdash;poor, humble, rough, made of coarse and heavy serge; a
penance for the religious, and a good example for others, as have
always been the poor and rough habits of religious orders. At the first
vacancy of the position of prior in Manila father Fray Diego was a
second time elected prior. He filled the post to the great benefit of
the religious and the convent, to the needs and obligations of which he
attended with great care and charity. He was by nature taciturn and
somewhat rigid, but by virtue was so corrected and mild that he left no
necessity unremedied, no afflicted whom he did not strive to console,
no weak or fallen one for whom he did not pray. With all he was gentle,
and to all he desired to do good. While he was in this position, and
very far from thinking of changing his condition, he received in the
year 1632 the royal decree appointing him bishop of Nueva Segovia. He
hesitated long before accepting this dignity, presenting many arguments
against his acceptance. But, since all the others were opposed to him
in this matter, he gave up his own opinion and accepted the episcopate,
with the most firm determination not to abandon his character as a
friar vowed to poverty and to observe the manner of living which he had
previously maintained&mdash;and even to improve it by far, as the
superior station upon which he entered required of him; and this
determination he most perfectly fulfilled, as will be seen. Someone
very much devoted to the order sent him a diamond cross for a pectoral;
and he returned it, saying that it was very rich for so poor a bishop,
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>whom a pectoral of wood would be sufficient. The
bulls did not reach him that year; so he waited for them without
leaving the cell in which he had lived in the hospital of the Chinese.
He took no servant, and made no change in his poor manner of living,
dress, and clothing. He went to the choir and performed the other
obligations of religious in this poor habit, and did everything else,
whether by day or in the midst of the night, that he had promised. He
was consecrated and went to his bishopric; and giving himself up wholly
to his obligations as bishop he personally visited all his bishopric,
leaving in all parts a lively memory of his sanctity, devotion, and
alms-giving. His common custom was to spend one hour of prayer before
mass, raising his fervor by mental devotion that he might say it with a
greater spiritual elevation. This was in addition to many other hours
of prayer by day and by night. After mass was finished, he spent
another hour in giving thanks to the Lord for what he had received; and
then he went immediately to his study of holy scripture, which likewise
is prayer. He did not rise from his work until something happened which
compelled him to. His expenses were almost nothing, so that the poor
income of his bishopric was wholly spent upon charity and upon the
adornments of his church; for in these two matters he spent as if he
were rich. Hence in the short time during which he governed the
bishopric (which was only a year and a half), he gave it more ornaments
and jewels than others who had been superiors there had given in many
years. He was most humble; and when father Fray Carlos Clemente Gant
was vicar of the convent, the bishop used to go almost daily from his
residence to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>our house to confess to him. When father Fray
Carlos begged him to remain at home, and said he would go to hear his
confession every day, the bishop declined, saying, &ldquo;Your
Reverence is very busy. I, who am less so, will come,&rdquo; and on
this footing this matter always continued. He took less food than when
he was in the order, giving up one meal when he accepted the bishopric.
He said that his position brought more obligations; therefore his food
ought to be less. He always ate fish, if necessity did not force him to
take something else. His bed was a piece of felt for a mattress and a
blanket for covering, without any other pillow than the mat used by the
poor Chinese, or one of the native mats&mdash;which was given a coat of
a sort of varnish, so that the perspiration might be washed off and the
pillow kept clean. In his whole house he had no other bed-clothes, so
that even in his last sickness he had no mattress nor sheets, nor even
a linen pillow upon which to rest his head; it was therefore necessary
to bring that which was kept ready in the poor infirmary of the
convent, for no such comforts were used or were to be found in the
bishop&rsquo;s house. When he went on visitation, he always took with
him some bundles of cloth to distribute among the poor, and these and
other good works which he did for them constituted the sole profit of
his visitation. He highly esteemed the ministers whom he had in his
bishopric, and was greatly pleased to see that they were practically
all religious&mdash;not only of his own order, but also of that of our
father St. Augustine. He loved both tenderly, and always had much good
to say of all of them. During his time another <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>bishop<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1983src" href=
"#xd21e1983" name="xd21e1983src">65</a> (who was a member of an order)
put forward a claim that the royal decrees should be put in execution
which provide that the religious who have charge of Indians shall be
subject to the inspection and visitation of the bishop or his visitors.
When this matter was discussed before the royal Audiencia, our good
bishop was present&mdash;yielding, so far as his bishopric was
concerned, the favor granted in these royal decrees. He declared and
proved with many strong arguments that, though the execution of the
decrees would greatly increase the dignity and temporal profit of the
bishops, it was to the spiritual and temporal injury of the Indians.
Hence, to avoid these greater injuries, he renounced with a good will
these inferior gains, as a prelate who felt that all his gains were
secured by procuring the proper ministry for those subject to him. The
whole income of his bishopric he collected for the poor, without taking
from it more than the labor or dividing it among the needy; for his own
maintenance, he asked alms as one of the poor. When on any account he
was absent from his bishopric, he left someone in it to distribute alms
to the poor, that they might not be injured by his absence.</p>
<p>The habit which he wore was of serge, and he wore an old frieze
cloak which had served one of the religious on his way from
Espa&ntilde;a. His shoes were old and patched, and his breeches poor
and mean, like those used in this province. He wore no rings, and did
not spend a real for them or for a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284"
href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>pectoral, being contented
with those which were offered to him as to a bishop in such a state of
poverty. When he entered our convents, he prostrated himself on the
floor to receive the blessing of the superior, as the other religious
do; and he joined the community and took no precedence in seating
himself, just like any of the other brothers. He did not permit them to
give him anything special in the refectory; and he remained in all
things as humble and as perfect in his duties, as a member of the
order, as he had been before becoming a bishop. The happy end of all
his many arduous labors was at hand; and after only three days of
sickness he went to receive the endless reward of his toils, leaving
those who were subject to him above measure sad at the loss of such a
superior, father, and common benefactor of all. But those who displayed
the greatest feeling, and with the greatest reason, were the religious
of this province, who had in him an honor, a defense, and an example,
which incited them to all virtue, and to strict observance of their
rules. [His death caused great sorrow, not only in his diocese but in
Manila, where he was beloved by all; and notable honors were paid to
his memory, even by the other orders.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The glorious martyrdom of four religious of this
province, and two laymen, their companions, in Japon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">May 2, 1637, there was elected as provincial father
Fray Carlos Clemente Gant, a native of the famous city of
Zarago&ccedil;a, and a son of the illustrious convent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>of
Preachers in that city, a person of much virtue and superior prudence,
of which he had given evidence in many offices which he had filled with
great praise. He was elected in this chapter on the first ballot, and
the wisdom of his election was soon shown, the Lord choosing him as a
principal instrument to bring to an end the congregation&mdash;which,
as has been narrated, had already begun to be planned, to the great
harm of these conversions.</p>
<p>[This year, which concludes the number of fifty since the foundation
of this province, is closed, as with a precious key, by the marvelous
martyrdom of four religious belonging to the province&mdash;father Fray
Antonio Gon&ccedil;alez, father Fray Guillermo Cortet (who here bore
the name of Fray Thomas de Sancto Domingo), father Fray Miguel de
Ozaraza, and father Fray Vicente de la Cruz. With the martyrdoms
(already narrated) of father Fray Jordan de San Estevan and Fray Thomas
de San Jacintho, the Japanese persecutors of the church had spilled the
blood of all the Dominican friars of that kingdom; yet they had not, as
they expected, caused the souls of the religious to fear, or cooled
their fervent desires to go to Japon. Of all those who asked for
permission to go thither, these four only received the desired license.
Two of them were teachers of theology in the college and university of
the province, in the city of Manila; and both of them had lectured on
theology before coming to this province&mdash;father Fray Antonio in
that of Espa&ntilde;a, and father Fray Guillermo in his native country
of France. Thus the province has sent its best to Japon. Father Fray
Francisco de Morales was for many years lecturer on theology, and at
the time of his mission was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href=
"#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>prior of the convent of Manila;
and father Fray Jacintho de Esquivel, father Fray Domingo de Erquicia,
father Fray Lucas del Espiritu Sancto, and father Fray Diego de Rivera
had all been lecturers on theology. There was great difficulty in
sending these four religious to Japon, which was finally overcome by
the determination of the religious. In the year 1634, some Spaniards
had been cast on shore on the islands of the Lequios, which are subject
to Japon. They were examined to see if they were religious or no; but,
as it did not appear that they were, they were set free. Many Japanese
came to them by night, asking them if they were priests to hear their
confessions; and, being assured that they were not, they begged for
priests to come to them. Father Fray Vincente de la Cruz and a
Christian Japanese offered to take the religious whom the province
might send and to make their way from the Lequios Islands to Japon. The
governor, learning that the expedition was about to be equipped, burned
the vessel which had been prepared, and set sentinels at the mouth of
the bay to prevent the religious from setting out. By God&rsquo;s aid
they succeeded in eluding him, and after meeting with storms made their
way to the islands of the Lequios, where they landed July 10, 1636. No
certain reports have been received as to what occurred in the islands;
but the fathers seem to have been arrested as soon as they revealed
themselves, and to have been sent as prisoners to Japon.</p>
<p>On September 13, 1637, fathers Fray Guillermo Cortet, Fray Miguel
O&ccedil;ara&ccedil;a and Fray Vicente de la Cruz, dressed in secular
clothes, were brought from Satzuma to Nangasaqui, to be tried for their
crime. Father Fray Antonio Gon&ccedil;alez was not with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>them, having sailed in another vessel, and not
having yet arrived. They answered boldly, declaring that they had had
no assistance from any government; and that their very pilot had been a
religious who had known something of seamanship before entering the
order. They were subjected to terrible torture, especially the torture
of water, which they bore bravely. Their tortures were prolonged, and
the text describes them with fulness. On the twenty-first of the same
month, father Fray Antonio Gon&ccedil;alez, the superior of the
religious, arrived in Nangasaqui in another funea. He was accompanied
by two lay companions&mdash;one a mestizo, the son of a Chinese man and
an Indian woman; the other a Japanese, who had been exiled for the
faith.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2013src" href="#xd21e2013" name=
"xd21e2013src">66</a> As soon as father Fray Antonio set foot on the
soil, he made the sign of the cross, in sight of all the Portuguese
trading there and of a great multitude of people. The holy father,
being of noble stature, towered above the company about him like
another Saul. He was taken directly before the judges, confessed who he
was, was cruelly tortured, and subjected to insult. The mestizo at
first feared the torments, but afterward plucked up his courage to
endure them. The Japanese wretchedly fell away from fear. Father Fray
Antonio suffered the torture of water, to which he was subjected when
he was very sick of a fever; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href=
"#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>and he died in the prison, his
body being burnt and the ashes cast into the sea. On the twenty-seventh
of the month the prisoners were taken out to be martyred, being gagged
to prevent their preaching. They were all suspended by the feet, and
while they hung in their pits they chanted praises to God; and the
ministers of justice, in admiration of their courage, caused them to be
taken out from the holes still alive and to be beheaded, that they
might no longer suffer torture. The ashes of the five holy martyrs were
cast into the sea, three leguas from the port of Nangasaqui, on the
same day, September 29, 1637.]</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter LXI</h3>
<h3 class="main">The exercises with which the Lord prepared these
saints for martyrdom</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[The Lord in general requires a holy life to precede a
martyr&rsquo;s death. Father Fray Antonio Gon&ccedil;alez was a native
of Leon, bred up for the Lord like another Samuel. He showed great
capacity in his studies, and became the master of the students in the
most religious convent of Piedrahita. Before his conversion, he was
devoted to poetry and such matters, which, though they do not take away
the grace of the Lord, choke the good seed of His special counsels and
the way of perfection. But before long father Fray Antonio gave up
these trifles, which, though they were not grave faults, were grave
impediments to the perfection to which the Lord called him. Considering
how God might best be pleased, it seemed to him that the best offering
he could make was the offering of martyrdom. As a means to attain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span>this end, he considered that coming to this
province offered the best opportunity for becoming a martyr. He devoted
himself to virtuous company, and was most useful as a minister in
Espa&ntilde;a. He begged his way from door to door, and set out for the
Philippinas when he was just recovering from a severe illness. He was
greatly given to works of mortification, and most patient, kind, and
obedient. He was devoted to be service of the Rosary, and offered a
special devotion, among many saints, to St. Peter Martyr, whom he
desired to imitate in life and in death. His martyrdom had been
predicted while he was in Espa&ntilde;a.</p>
<p>Father Fray Guillermo Cortet was a native of Visiers, a city of
France. He was the child of noble and wealthy parents. While still a
young layman he heard of the glory of our holy martyrs in Japon, which
made such an impression upon his heart that he determined to give up
all that he had and might hope for in the world, and to assume the
habit of the order which contained such saints, hoping that he himself
might be one of them. He therefore requested the habit from father Fray
Sebastian Michaelis, who at that time governed the strictest
congregation in France. In time he professed, and became notable for
religion, virtue, and learning. So closely did he observe the rule
that, when the famous convent of the order in Avi&ntilde;on was to be
reformed, father Fray Guillermo was sent there for the purpose. All
this time he was sighing for Japon, and finally set out on foot for
Espa&ntilde;a, making the journey in the winter through rain, cold, and
snow. He was greatly esteemed in the court, but left it to come to the
Philippinas as a member of the congregation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name="pb290">290</a>]</span>This
he abandoned when he heard the convincing reasons with which the
province, though obeying the most reverend general and his letters,
suspended the execution of them until they could give him information
as to the surreptitious manner in which they were obtained, the many
impossibilities which they contained within themselves, and the harm
which would be done to the work of conversion by the establishment of
the congregation. The province directed him to teach theology in the
college of Sancto Thomas at Manila, which he did obediently, putting
aside his desire to go to Japon. That he might have more time and ease
in the holy exercise of prayer, he never undressed at night during the
last twenty years of his life, but slept seated in a chair. This
country is infested with multitudes of annoying mosquitos; but he did
not take advantage of the common means of preventing them, which is a
tent, something permitted to all the religious. He would not accept
one, but offered to the Lord the stings of the gnats, which is no small
mortification and penance. It was no wonder that he paid small
attention to the stings of mosquitos, as he often wore next to his skin
a girdle bearing fifteen rosettes in honor of our Lady of the Rosary
and her fifteen mysteries, with points so sharp that they drew blood
when they were touched with the finger. Besides this he wore an iron
chain, which was kept bright by wear and gleamed as if it were
polished; and in addition to all these things he sometimes wore next
his skin a hair shirt, with points of iron so cruel and large that the
mere sight of them shocked some religious who happened to see them, as
being the most severe thing that they had ever seen in their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>lives. He was most abstinent, full of devotion
for the mass, and above measure humble. He was also very kind and
gentle, especially to repentant sinners. He was scarcely a year in this
province when his ardent desire to go to Japon was finally
gratified.</p>
<p>Father Fray Miguel de Ozaraza was a native of Vizcaya; and because
of his virtues, devotion, and prudence he was much beloved in the
convent of Sancto Thomas at Madrid, where he lived for some years in
great quiet, with all the comfort that a good religious could desire.
But as many laymen have been moved by the desire of worldly riches to
leave their comforts in Espa&ntilde;a and to go to the Indias, so the
desire for spiritual profit caused father Fray Miguel to come to this
most distant part of the world. He was very industrious, and skilful in
the management of business; and had much to do with the management of
the affairs of the shipload of religious with which it was intended to
begin the new congregation. When he came to the province, and more
clearly understood the condition of affairs here, he left the
congregation and was incorporated into the province. For this he
obtained the reward of martyrdom for which he sought. No opportunity
for him to go to Japon immediately offering, he was directed to learn
an Indian language, and to minister to the Indians; this he did with
humble obedience, not looking down upon this despised ministry. At the
same time he studied the Japanese language. His fortitude in martyrdom
was supernatural and divine.]</p>
<p>Father Fray Vicente de la Cruz, whose Japanese name was Xivozzuca,
was a native of Japan, the child of devoted Christians of long
standing, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>was the youngest of seven brothers. He was
offered to God before his birth; for, while he was still in his
mother&rsquo;s womb, his parents promised that, if they should have a
son, they would offer him like a second Samuel to the service of the
church. They bred him in this way as one dedicated to such a service,
never permitting him to wear any colored clothes like other boys of his
rank, that he might grow up with the sense of being dedicated to God,
and of being bound to serve Him with all care and devotion. At the age
of nine he was given to the fathers of the Society in fulfilment of the
vow; and from that tender age began to be trained in Nangasaqui in the
college of the fathers there&mdash;studying grammar, and the other
moral teaching given by the fathers of the Society to those who are to
aid them in their preaching. This Vicente did for many years, up to the
persecution which broke out, with the fury described, in the year 1614.
At this time Vicente went to Manila, when the ministers were exiled,
returning soon afterwards to Japon; but like the dove in the ark, not
finding a place whereon to set his foot, because of the persecution, he
returned again to this city, seeking some established way in which he
could serve the Lord as a minister of the church. He suffered great
need, and was tempted by friends and acquaintances to change his plans
and to marry; but he did not consent, preferring to be poor and needy
in the house of the Lord than to live with ease among laymen. The Lord,
who never fails those who put their trust in him, helped him by making
him acquainted with the bishop of Zubu, Don Fray Pedro de Arce, a
master of such virtue that the virtues of Vicente could not fail to
advance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>under him. Father Fray Luis Sotelo afterwards
came to this city with the purpose of taking preachers to Japon, and
Vicente joined him, being prepared for every good work, even at the
expense of the hardship and danger required by the preaching of the
faith in Japon. It was not yet time for this holy man to suffer, and
hence he was prevented by sickness from accompanying the holy martyr
Fray Luis Sotelo when he went to Japon; so he remained in this country,
teaching the language to the religious who were to go to that realm. In
this and in all his actions his conduct was so virtuous that the
Christian Japanese offered him a liberal support, so that he was
ordained priest and gave them his spiritual aid, preaching to them and
administering the holy sacraments. That he might live with great
perfection, he followed the rule of the tertiary Order of the noble St.
Francis. The expedition of these holy martyrs was about to take place,
and the superior of it endeavored to have father Fray Vicente accompany
and guide them, as he was a native Japanese who had had experience in
the preaching of the gospel in that realm. He not only readily agreed
to this, but earnestly begged for the habit of the order; and he wore
it&mdash;in such manner as he could, since he was going to preach in
Japon&mdash;for more than a year; he professed and suffered, as has
been described. May the Lord give us for the merits and intercession of
these glorious martyrs,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2044src" href=
"#xd21e2044" name="xd21e2044src">67</a> and of all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>the
other holy martyrs and confessors who have been in this province,
something of the divine grace which made them such as they were. Thus,
as up to this time the present members of the province have not belied
the holy beginnings with which it was established, but rather seem to
perfect themselves with each new increase, so may we not fall off in
the future; but may our love toward God and our fellow-men, and our
devotion to the rule of our order, forever preserve the perfection
which has been found hitherto in the sons of the province, to the glory
of the Author of all good, who is the same Lord God to whom belongs all
glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>After the fifty years of this history were completed, there came the
following letter from his Majesty, which settled the matter which had
disturbed the religious of this province and kept them in affliction.
This letter was received, as has been said in the history, without any
representation from the province having come to the royal ears; hence
it is a most certain proof that it was given by the special providence
of the Lord, and by the aid of our great patroness the Virgin Mother;
and that it is worthy to be placed as a conclusion to this history.

<p class="first">(Copied faithfully from the original.)</p>
<p>The King. To the venerable and devout father provincial of the Order
of St. Dominic of the Philipinas Islands. From different reports which
I have received, I have learned of the disturbance and disquiet caused
among the religious of that province by the division of it that was
made by virtue of letters obtained from the general of the order by
Fray Diego Collado, and by the aid given him for the purpose by Don
Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera, my governor and captain-general of these
islands. I desired that the said briefs should not be executed, since
they were not approved by my royal Council of the Indias; and hence,
looking rather to the conformity of the religious with the rule of the
order, and to the quiet of that province, and perceiving that the said
division must cause some relaxation therein, I have commanded my said
governor and captain-general of these islands, and my royal Audiencia,
to suspend the said brief and all other briefs brought by the said Fray
Diego Collado, without permitting them to be executed. And I have
commanded that the division of the provinces which has been made shall
be annulled, and that they shall return to the condition in which they
were before the said division. I accordingly request and direct you to
attend to it, on your part, that these said provinces shall be placed
in the state in which they were before <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Espa&ntilde;a immediately. That this may have effect, I have in a
letter of this day commanded my said governor to have him provided with
passage. You will inform me at the first opportunity of what you shall
have done in execution of what I thus request of you. Dated at Madrid,
February first, in the year one thousand six hundred and

Notwithstanding this fierce persecution&mdash;which, thus begun,
culminated in the massacre of Shimabara (1637), and lasted as long as
Christians could be discovered by the Japanese authorities&mdash;a
considerable number of Japanese converts maintained their Christian
faith, unknown to their rulers, handing it down from one generation to
another until 1868, when their existence became known to the
government, and for a time they were exiled from their homes, but were
restored to them a few years later. This Christian church was at
Urakami, about seven miles north of Nagasaki.</p>

thither, reaching that country in August, 1618. In the following
December he was arrested, and imprisoned in Omura. He remained there

Armies were raised on both sides, and on June 4, 1615, the castle of

reference in our text is to Go-Midzuno-o, who was mikado from 1611 to
1630; in the latter year he abdicated that dignity, forced to this step
by petty persecutions and interference by the sh&ocirc;gun Hidetada,
and lived in retirement for the rest of his life, dying in 1680. The
statement as to cutting off his hair is hardly accurate in regard to
its rarity, as it was then the custom for potentates of various degrees
to abdicate their office at an early period therein, and retire into a
Buddhist monastery, on which occasion the head of the candidate was
shaved. <i>Dairi</i> is merely one of the appellations bestowed upon
the mikado of Japan (see <span class="sc">Vol. XIX</span>, p. 51). The
term <i>mikado</i> is practically the equivalent of &ldquo;Sublime
Porte;&rdquo; the first to bear this name was Jimmu-Tenn&ocirc;
(660&ndash;585 B. C.), and his dynasty has continued to the present
day. After the conquest of Korea (202 A. D.) Chinese influences began
to affect Japan; and the mikado&rsquo;s authority was gradually
diminished by powerful chiefs and lords, until the dignity of
sh&ocirc;gun&mdash;a military title of honor&mdash;was conferred (1192)
upon Yoritomo, and made hereditary in his family. From that time dates
the dual monarchy which ruled Japan&mdash;the mikado being but the
nominal sovereign&mdash;until 1868; the revolution of that year
suppressed the sh&ocirc;gunate, and restored to the mikado his rightful
authority. The mikado&rsquo;s residence was established at Ki&ocirc;to
in 793, where it remained until 1868, being then transferred to Yedo
(now T&ocirc;ki&ocirc;). The comparison of the mikado to a pope arose
from his possessing certain prerogatives in religious matters, and
because a sort of divine character was ascribed to him from the claim
of the first mikado that he was a descendant of the sun-goddess
Amaterasu. See Rein&rsquo;s <i>Japan</i>, pp. 214, 224, 315&ndash;317;

Somonaga (in religion, de Santa Maria) was born in Omura of Christian
parents; he had ability as a speaker, and often preached while a
student. He came to Manila, and at first became an Augustinian;
afterward, he entered the Dominican order (August 15, 1624), being then
forty-three years of age. In 1627 he was in Formosa; in 1632 he went
from Manila to Japan, and in the following year died as a martyr. (See

Manila&mdash;except 1619&ndash;21, at Binondo&mdash;until 1623, when he
went to Japan&mdash;where he labored, in spite of persecution and
sufferings, until his martyrdom, August 18, 1633. (See <i lang=

convent there, but was ordained in Mexico. In 1618 he came to Manila,
and was assigned to the ministry among the Chinese there. In 1628 and
1629 he was in Camboja, but was unable to establish a mission there. In
1633 he went to China; after spending several years in the missions
there, he was sent (1640) by his order to Europe, to make complaint
regarding the practice of the &ldquo;Chinese rites&rdquo; by the
Jesuits in China. Taking the overland route from Goa, Morales arrived
in Italy in January, 1643; five years later, he escorted a band of
missionaries to Manila, and in 1649 returned to China. He spent the
rest of his life there, dying at Fo-Kien, September 17, 1664. (See

Allusion is here made to the famous town of Santiago de Compostela,
formerly the capital of Galicia. Its foundation was due to the alleged
discovery (in the ninth Century) of the burial place of St. James the
apostle, who afterward became the patron saint of Spain. A church was
built over the tomb of the saint, by Alfonso I, but was destroyed by
the Saracens; the present cathedral was begun about 1080. It soon
became a noted resort of pilgrims, being visited by many thousands
every year, and has continued to be such to the present time.</p>

Japanese was named Lazaro; he was one of the lepers who had been
formerly exiled from Japan for the faith, and came with the Dominicans
as a guide. Although at first he denied the Christian faith, under
pressure of torture, he afterward recovered courage, and died as a
martyr, September 29, 1637. The mestizo was Lorenzo Ruiz, a native of
Binondo; he had left Luz&oacute;n on account of a murder that he had
committed there. He also was martyred, at the same time as Lazaro. (See

<p class="footnote">It is well to note, in this connection, the fact
that the persecutions of Christians in Japan were not, in the main, on
religious grounds. The Japanese government was tolerant to the new
religion until it had reason to fear that its authority was being
subverted by the influence of the missionaries, and the independence of
the nation threatened by the foreign nations who sent to Japan the
priests and traders. See Griffis&rsquo;s <i>Mikado&rsquo;s Empire</i>,
pp. 247&ndash;259, Rein&rsquo;s <i>Japan</i>, pp. 290&ndash;293, and

457&ndash;506. The last-named cites at length the writings of
